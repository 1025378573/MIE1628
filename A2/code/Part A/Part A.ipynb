beauty's rose might never die,</td></tr><tr><td>  But as the riper should by time decease,</td></tr><tr><td>  His tender heir might bear his memory:</td></tr><tr><td>  But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,</td></tr><tr><td>  Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,</td></tr><tr><td>  Making a famine where abundance lies,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:</td></tr><tr><td>  Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,</td></tr><tr><td>  And only herald to the gaudy spring,</td></tr><tr><td>  Within thine own bud buriest thy content,</td></tr><tr><td>  And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:</td></tr><tr><td>    Pity the world, or else this glutton be,</td></tr><tr><td>    To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     2</td></tr><tr><td>  When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,</td></tr><tr><td>  And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,</td></tr><tr><td>  Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:</td></tr><tr><td>  Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,</td></tr><tr><td>  Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;</td></tr><tr><td>  To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,</td></tr><tr><td>  Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.</td></tr><tr><td>  How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,</td></tr><tr><td>  If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine</td></tr><tr><td>  Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse'</td></tr><tr><td>  Proving his beauty by succession thine.</td></tr><tr><td>    This were to be new made when thou art old,</td></tr><tr><td>    And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     3</td></tr><tr><td>  Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,</td></tr><tr><td>  Now is the time that face should form another,</td></tr><tr><td>  Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.</td></tr><tr><td>  For where is she so fair whose uneared womb</td></tr><tr><td>  Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?</td></tr><tr><td>  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,</td></tr><tr><td>  Of his self-love to stop posterity?</td></tr><tr><td>  Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee</td></tr><tr><td>  Calls back the lovely April of her prime,</td></tr><tr><td>  So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,</td></tr><tr><td>  Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.</td></tr><tr><td>    But if thou live remembered not to be,</td></tr><tr><td>    Die single and thine image dies with thee.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     4</td></tr><tr><td>  Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,</td></tr><tr><td>  Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?</td></tr><tr><td>  Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,</td></tr><tr><td>  And being frank she lends to those are free:</td></tr><tr><td>  Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,</td></tr><tr><td>  The bounteous largess given thee to give?</td></tr><tr><td>  Profitless usurer why dost thou use</td></tr><tr><td>  So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?</td></tr><tr><td>  For having traffic with thy self alone,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,</td></tr><tr><td>  Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,</td></tr><tr><td>  What acceptable audit canst thou leave?</td></tr><tr><td>    Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which used lives th' executor to be.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     5</td></tr><tr><td>  Those hours that with gentle work did frame</td></tr><tr><td>  The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell</td></tr><tr><td>  Will play the tyrants to the very same,</td></tr><tr><td>  And that unfair which fairly doth excel:</td></tr><tr><td>  For never-resting time leads summer on</td></tr><tr><td>  To hideous winter and confounds him there,</td></tr><tr><td>  Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,</td></tr><tr><td>  Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:</td></tr><tr><td>  Then were not summer's distillation left</td></tr><tr><td>  A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,</td></tr><tr><td>  Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,</td></tr><tr><td>  Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.</td></tr><tr><td>    But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,</td></tr><tr><td>    Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     6</td></tr><tr><td>  Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,</td></tr><tr><td>  In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:</td></tr><tr><td>  Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,</td></tr><tr><td>  With beauty's treasure ere it be self-killed:</td></tr><tr><td>  That use is not forbidden usury,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which happies those that pay the willing loan;</td></tr><tr><td>  That's for thy self to breed another thee,</td></tr><tr><td>  Or ten times happier be it ten for one,</td></tr><tr><td>  Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,</td></tr><tr><td>  If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:</td></tr><tr><td>  Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,</td></tr><tr><td>  Leaving thee living in posterity?</td></tr><tr><td>    Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,</td></tr><tr><td>    To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     7</td></tr><tr><td>  Lo in the orient when the gracious light</td></tr><tr><td>  Lifts up his burning head, each under eye</td></tr><tr><td>  Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,</td></tr><tr><td>  Serving with looks his sacred majesty,</td></tr><tr><td>  And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,</td></tr><tr><td>  Resembling strong youth in his middle age,</td></tr><tr><td>  Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,</td></tr><tr><td>  Attending on his golden pilgrimage:</td></tr><tr><td>  But when from highmost pitch with weary car,</td></tr><tr><td>  Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,</td></tr><tr><td>  The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are</td></tr><tr><td>  From his low tract and look another way:</td></tr><tr><td>    So thou, thy self out-going in thy noon:</td></tr><tr><td>    Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     8</td></tr><tr><td>  Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?</td></tr><tr><td>  Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:</td></tr><tr><td>  Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,</td></tr><tr><td>  Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?</td></tr><tr><td>  If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,</td></tr><tr><td>  By unions married do offend thine ear,</td></tr><tr><td>  They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds</td></tr><tr><td>  In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:</td></tr><tr><td>  Mark how one string sweet husband to another,</td></tr><tr><td>  Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;</td></tr><tr><td>  Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,</td></tr><tr><td>  Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:</td></tr><tr><td>    Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,</td></tr><tr><td>    Sings this to thee, 'Thou single wilt prove none'.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     9</td></tr><tr><td>  Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,</td></tr><tr><td>  That thou consum'st thy self in single life?</td></tr><tr><td>  Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,</td></tr><tr><td>  The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,</td></tr><tr><td>  The world will be thy widow and still weep,</td></tr><tr><td>  That thou no form of thee hast left behind,</td></tr><tr><td>  When every private widow well may keep,</td></tr><tr><td>  By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:</td></tr><tr><td>  Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend</td></tr><tr><td>  Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;</td></tr><tr><td>  But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,</td></tr><tr><td>  And kept unused the user so destroys it:</td></tr><tr><td>    No love toward others in that bosom sits</td></tr><tr><td>    That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     10</td></tr><tr><td>  For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any</td></tr><tr><td>  Who for thy self art so unprovident.</td></tr><tr><td>  Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,</td></tr><tr><td>  But that thou none lov'st is most evident:</td></tr><tr><td>  For thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate,</td></tr><tr><td>  That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,</td></tr><tr><td>  Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate</td></tr><tr><td>  Which to repair should be thy chief desire:</td></tr><tr><td>  O change thy thought, that I may change my mind,</td></tr><tr><td>  Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?</td></tr><tr><td>  Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,</td></tr><tr><td>  Or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove,</td></tr><tr><td>    Make thee another self for love of me,</td></tr><tr><td>    That beauty still may live in thine or thee.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     11</td></tr><tr><td>  As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st,</td></tr><tr><td>  In one of thine, from that which thou departest,</td></tr><tr><td>  And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,</td></tr><tr><td>  Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,</td></tr><tr><td>  Without this folly, age, and cold decay,</td></tr><tr><td>  If all were minded so, the times should cease,</td></tr><tr><td>  And threescore year would make the world away:</td></tr><tr><td>  Let those whom nature hath not made for store,</td></tr><tr><td>  Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:</td></tr><tr><td>  Look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;</td></tr><tr><td>  Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:</td></tr><tr><td>    She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     12</td></tr><tr><td>  When I do count the clock that tells the time,</td></tr><tr><td>  And see the brave day sunk in hideous night,</td></tr><tr><td>  When I behold the violet past prime,</td></tr><tr><td>  And sable curls all silvered o'er with white:</td></tr><tr><td>  When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which erst from heat did canopy the herd</td></tr><tr><td>  And summer's green all girded up in sheaves</td></tr><tr><td>  Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:</td></tr><tr><td>  Then of thy beauty do I question make</td></tr><tr><td>  That thou among the wastes of time must go,</td></tr><tr><td>  Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,</td></tr><tr><td>  And die as fast as they see others grow,</td></tr><tr><td>    And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence</td></tr><tr><td>    Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     13</td></tr><tr><td>  O that you were your self, but love you are</td></tr><tr><td>  No longer yours, than you your self here live,</td></tr><tr><td>  Against this coming end you should prepare,</td></tr><tr><td>  And your sweet semblance to some other give.</td></tr><tr><td>  So should that beauty which you hold in lease</td></tr><tr><td>  Find no determination, then you were</td></tr><tr><td>  Your self again after your self's decease,</td></tr><tr><td>  When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.</td></tr><tr><td>  Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which husbandry in honour might uphold,</td></tr><tr><td>  Against the stormy gusts of winter's day</td></tr><tr><td>  And barren rage of death's eternal cold?</td></tr><tr><td>    O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,</td></tr><tr><td>    You had a father, let your son say so.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     14</td></tr><tr><td>  Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck,</td></tr><tr><td>  And yet methinks I have astronomy,</td></tr><tr><td>  But not to tell of good, or evil luck,</td></tr><tr><td>  Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality,</td></tr><tr><td>  Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;</td></tr><tr><td>  Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,</td></tr><tr><td>  Or say with princes if it shall go well</td></tr><tr><td>  By oft predict that I in heaven find.</td></tr><tr><td>  But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,</td></tr><tr><td>  And constant stars in them I read such art</td></tr><tr><td>  As truth and beauty shall together thrive</td></tr><tr><td>  If from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert:</td></tr><tr><td>    Or else of thee this I prognosticate,</td></tr><tr><td>    Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     15</td></tr><tr><td>  When I consider every thing that grows</td></tr><tr><td>  Holds in perfection but a little moment.</td></tr><tr><td>  That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows</td></tr><tr><td>  Whereon the stars in secret influence comment.</td></tr><tr><td>  When I perceive that men as plants increase,</td></tr><tr><td>  Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky:</td></tr><tr><td>  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,</td></tr><tr><td>  And wear their brave state out of memory.</td></tr><tr><td>  Then the conceit of this inconstant stay,</td></tr><tr><td>  Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,</td></tr><tr><td>  Where wasteful time debateth with decay</td></tr><tr><td>  To change your day of youth to sullied night,</td></tr><tr><td>    And all in war with Time for love of you,</td></tr><tr><td>    As he takes from you, I engraft you new.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     16</td></tr><tr><td>  But wherefore do not you a mightier way</td></tr><tr><td>  Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time?</td></tr><tr><td>  And fortify your self in your decay</td></tr><tr><td>  With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?</td></tr><tr><td>  Now stand you on the top of happy hours,</td></tr><tr><td>  And many maiden gardens yet unset,</td></tr><tr><td>  With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,</td></tr><tr><td>  Much liker than your painted counterfeit:</td></tr><tr><td>  So should the lines of life that life repair</td></tr><tr><td>  Which this (Time's pencil) or my pupil pen</td></tr><tr><td>  Neither in inward worth nor outward fair</td></tr><tr><td>  Can make you live your self in eyes of men.</td></tr><tr><td>    To give away your self, keeps your self still,</td></tr><tr><td>    And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     17</td></tr><tr><td>  Who will believe my verse in time to come</td></tr><tr><td>  If it were filled with your most high deserts?</td></tr><tr><td>  Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb</td></tr><tr><td>  Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts:</td></tr><tr><td>  If I could write the beauty of your eyes,</td></tr><tr><td>  And in fresh numbers number all your graces,</td></tr><tr><td>  The age to come would say this poet lies,</td></tr><tr><td>  Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces.</td></tr><tr><td>  So should my papers (yellowed with their age)</td></tr><tr><td>  Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,</td></tr><tr><td>  And your true rights be termed a poet's rage,</td></tr><tr><td>  And stretched metre of an antique song.</td></tr><tr><td>    But were some child of yours alive that time,</td></tr><tr><td>    You should live twice in it, and in my rhyme.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     18</td></tr><tr><td>  Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?</td></tr><tr><td>  Thou art more lovely and more temperate:</td></tr><tr><td>  Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</td></tr><tr><td>  And summer's lease hath all too short a date:</td></tr><tr><td>  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</td></tr><tr><td>  And often is his gold complexion dimmed,</td></tr><tr><td>  And every fair from fair sometime declines,</td></tr><tr><td>  By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed:</td></tr><tr><td>  But thy eternal summer shall not fade,</td></tr><tr><td>  Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,</td></tr><tr><td>  Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,</td></tr><tr><td>  When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,</td></tr><tr><td>    So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,</td></tr><tr><td>    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     19</td></tr><tr><td>  Devouring Time blunt thou the lion's paws,</td></tr><tr><td>  And make the earth devour her own sweet brood,</td></tr><tr><td>  Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,</td></tr><tr><td>  And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,</td></tr><tr><td>  Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st,</td></tr><tr><td>  And do whate'er thou wilt swift-footed Time</td></tr><tr><td>  To the wide world and all her fading sweets:</td></tr><tr><td>  But I forbid thee one most heinous crime,</td></tr><tr><td>  O carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,</td></tr><tr><td>  Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen,</td></tr><tr><td>  Him in thy course untainted do allow,</td></tr><tr><td>  For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.</td></tr><tr><td>    Yet do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,</td></tr><tr><td>    My love shall in my verse ever live young.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     20</td></tr><tr><td>  A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,</td></tr><tr><td>  Hast thou the master mistress of my passion,</td></tr><tr><td>  A woman's gentle heart but not acquainted</td></tr><tr><td>  With shifting change as is false women's fashion,</td></tr><tr><td>  An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:</td></tr><tr><td>  Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth,</td></tr><tr><td>  A man in hue all hues in his controlling,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.</td></tr><tr><td>  And for a woman wert thou first created,</td></tr><tr><td>  Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,</td></tr><tr><td>  And by addition me of thee defeated,</td></tr><tr><td>  By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.</td></tr><tr><td>    But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,</td></tr><tr><td>    Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     21</td></tr><tr><td>  So is it not with me as with that muse,</td></tr><tr><td>  Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,</td></tr><tr><td>  Who heaven it self for ornament doth use,</td></tr><tr><td>  And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,</td></tr><tr><td>  Making a couplement of proud compare</td></tr><tr><td>  With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems:</td></tr><tr><td>  With April's first-born flowers and all things rare,</td></tr><tr><td>  That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.</td></tr><tr><td>  O let me true in love but truly write,</td></tr><tr><td>  And then believe me, my love is as fair,</td></tr><tr><td>  As any mother's child, though not so bright</td></tr><tr><td>  As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air:</td></tr><tr><td>    Let them say more that like of hearsay well,</td></tr><tr><td>    I will not praise that purpose not to sell.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     22</td></tr><tr><td>  My glass shall not persuade me I am old,</td></tr><tr><td>  So long as youth and thou are of one date,</td></tr><tr><td>  But when in thee time's furrows I behold,</td></tr><tr><td>  Then look I death my days should expiate.</td></tr><tr><td>  For all that beauty that doth cover thee,</td></tr><tr><td>  Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me,</td></tr><tr><td>  How can I then be elder than thou art?</td></tr><tr><td>  O therefore love be of thyself so wary,</td></tr><tr><td>  As I not for my self, but for thee will,</td></tr><tr><td>  Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary</td></tr><tr><td>  As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.</td></tr><tr><td>    Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     23</td></tr><tr><td>  As an unperfect actor on the stage,</td></tr><tr><td>  Who with his fear is put beside his part,</td></tr><tr><td>  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,</td></tr><tr><td>  Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;</td></tr><tr><td>  So I for fear of trust, forget to say,</td></tr><tr><td>  The perfect ceremony of love's rite,</td></tr><tr><td>  And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,</td></tr><tr><td>  O'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might:</td></tr><tr><td>  O let my looks be then the eloquence,</td></tr><tr><td>  And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,</td></tr><tr><td>  Who plead for love, and look for recompense,</td></tr><tr><td>  More than that tongue that more hath more expressed.</td></tr><tr><td>    O learn to read what silent love hath writ,</td></tr><tr><td>    To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     24</td></tr><tr><td>  Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy beauty's form in table of my heart,</td></tr><tr><td>  My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,</td></tr><tr><td>  And perspective it is best painter's art.</td></tr><tr><td>  For through the painter must you see his skill,</td></tr><tr><td>  To find where your true image pictured lies,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,</td></tr><tr><td>  That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes:</td></tr><tr><td>  Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,</td></tr><tr><td>  Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me</td></tr><tr><td>  Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun</td></tr><tr><td>  Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;</td></tr><tr><td>    Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,</td></tr><tr><td>    They draw but what they see, know not the heart.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     25</td></tr><tr><td>  Let those who are in favour with their stars,</td></tr><tr><td>  Of public honour and proud titles boast,</td></tr><tr><td>  Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars</td></tr><tr><td>  Unlooked for joy in that I honour most;</td></tr><tr><td>  Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread,</td></tr><tr><td>  But as the marigold at the sun's eye,</td></tr><tr><td>  And in themselves their pride lies buried,</td></tr><tr><td>  For at a frown they in their glory die.</td></tr><tr><td>  The painful warrior famoused for fight,</td></tr><tr><td>  After a thousand victories once foiled,</td></tr><tr><td>  Is from the book of honour razed quite,</td></tr><tr><td>  And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:</td></tr><tr><td>    Then happy I that love and am beloved</td></tr><tr><td>    Where I may not remove nor be removed.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     26</td></tr><tr><td>  Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit;</td></tr><tr><td>  To thee I send this written embassage</td></tr><tr><td>  To witness duty, not to show my wit.</td></tr><tr><td>  Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine</td></tr><tr><td>  May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it;</td></tr><tr><td>  But that I hope some good conceit of thine</td></tr><tr><td>  In thy soul's thought (all naked) will bestow it:</td></tr><tr><td>  Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,</td></tr><tr><td>  Points on me graciously with fair aspect,</td></tr><tr><td>  And puts apparel on my tattered loving,</td></tr><tr><td>  To show me worthy of thy sweet respect,</td></tr><tr><td>    Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,</td></tr><tr><td>    Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     27</td></tr><tr><td>  Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,</td></tr><tr><td>  The dear respose for limbs with travel tired,</td></tr><tr><td>  But then begins a journey in my head</td></tr><tr><td>  To work my mind, when body's work's expired.</td></tr><tr><td>  For then my thoughts (from far where I abide)</td></tr><tr><td>  Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,</td></tr><tr><td>  And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,</td></tr><tr><td>  Looking on darkness which the blind do see.</td></tr><tr><td>  Save that my soul's imaginary sight</td></tr><tr><td>  Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which like a jewel (hung in ghastly night)</td></tr><tr><td>  Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.</td></tr><tr><td>    Lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind,</td></tr><tr><td>    For thee, and for my self, no quiet find.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     28</td></tr><tr><td>  How can I then return in happy plight</td></tr><tr><td>  That am debarred the benefit of rest?</td></tr><tr><td>  When day's oppression is not eased by night,</td></tr><tr><td>  But day by night and night by day oppressed.</td></tr><tr><td>  And each (though enemies to either's reign)</td></tr><tr><td>  Do in consent shake hands to torture me,</td></tr><tr><td>  The one by toil, the other to complain</td></tr><tr><td>  How far I toil, still farther off from thee.</td></tr><tr><td>  I tell the day to please him thou art bright,</td></tr><tr><td>  And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:</td></tr><tr><td>  So flatter I the swart-complexioned night,</td></tr><tr><td>  When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.</td></tr><tr><td>    But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,</td></tr><tr><td>    And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     29</td></tr><tr><td>  When in disgrace with Fortune and men's eyes,</td></tr><tr><td>  I all alone beweep my outcast state,</td></tr><tr><td>  And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,</td></tr><tr><td>  And look upon my self and curse my fate,</td></tr><tr><td>  Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,</td></tr><tr><td>  Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,</td></tr><tr><td>  Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,</td></tr><tr><td>  With what I most enjoy contented least,</td></tr><tr><td>  Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,</td></tr><tr><td>  Haply I think on thee, and then my state,</td></tr><tr><td>  (Like to the lark at break of day arising</td></tr><tr><td>  From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven's gate,</td></tr><tr><td>    For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,</td></tr><tr><td>    That then I scorn to change my state with kings.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     30</td></tr><tr><td>  When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,</td></tr><tr><td>  I summon up remembrance of things past,</td></tr><tr><td>  I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,</td></tr><tr><td>  And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:</td></tr><tr><td>  Then can I drown an eye (unused to flow)</td></tr><tr><td>  For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,</td></tr><tr><td>  And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe,</td></tr><tr><td>  And moan th' expense of many a vanished sight.</td></tr><tr><td>  Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,</td></tr><tr><td>  And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er</td></tr><tr><td>  The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which I new pay as if not paid before.</td></tr><tr><td>    But if the while I think on thee (dear friend)</td></tr><tr><td>    All losses are restored, and sorrows end.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     31</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which I by lacking have supposed dead,</td></tr><tr><td>  And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,</td></tr><tr><td>  And all those friends which I thought buried.</td></tr><tr><td>  How many a holy and obsequious tear</td></tr><tr><td>  Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,</td></tr><tr><td>  As interest of the dead, which now appear,</td></tr><tr><td>  But things removed that hidden in thee lie.</td></tr><tr><td>  Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,</td></tr><tr><td>  Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,</td></tr><tr><td>  Who all their parts of me to thee did give,</td></tr><tr><td>  That due of many, now is thine alone.</td></tr><tr><td>    Their images I loved, I view in thee,</td></tr><tr><td>    And thou (all they) hast all the all of me.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     32</td></tr><tr><td>  If thou survive my well-contented day,</td></tr><tr><td>  When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover</td></tr><tr><td>  And shalt by fortune once more re-survey</td></tr><tr><td>  These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover:</td></tr><tr><td>  Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,</td></tr><tr><td>  And though they be outstripped by every pen,</td></tr><tr><td>  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,</td></tr><tr><td>  Exceeded by the height of happier men.</td></tr><tr><td>  O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought,</td></tr><tr><td>  'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,</td></tr><tr><td>  A dearer birth than this his love had brought</td></tr><tr><td>  To march in ranks of better equipage:</td></tr><tr><td>    But since he died and poets better prove,</td></tr><tr><td>    Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love'.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     33</td></tr><tr><td>  Full many a glorious morning have I seen,</td></tr><tr><td>  Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,</td></tr><tr><td>  Kissing with golden face the meadows green;</td></tr><tr><td>  Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy:</td></tr><tr><td>  Anon permit the basest clouds to ride,</td></tr><tr><td>  With ugly rack on his celestial face,</td></tr><tr><td>  And from the forlorn world his visage hide</td></tr><tr><td>  Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:</td></tr><tr><td>  Even so my sun one early morn did shine,</td></tr><tr><td>  With all triumphant splendour on my brow,</td></tr><tr><td>  But out alack, he was but one hour mine,</td></tr><tr><td>  The region cloud hath masked him from me now.</td></tr><tr><td>    Yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth,</td></tr><tr><td>    Suns of the world may stain, when heaven's sun staineth.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     34</td></tr><tr><td>  Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,</td></tr><tr><td>  And make me travel forth without my cloak,</td></tr><tr><td>  To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,</td></tr><tr><td>  Hiding thy brav'ry in their rotten smoke?</td></tr><tr><td>  'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,</td></tr><tr><td>  To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,</td></tr><tr><td>  For no man well of such a salve can speak,</td></tr><tr><td>  That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:</td></tr><tr><td>  Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief,</td></tr><tr><td>  Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss,</td></tr><tr><td>  Th' offender's sorrow lends but weak relief</td></tr><tr><td>  To him that bears the strong offence's cross.</td></tr><tr><td>    Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,</td></tr><tr><td>    And they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     35</td></tr><tr><td>  No more be grieved at that which thou hast done,</td></tr><tr><td>  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud,</td></tr><tr><td>  Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,</td></tr><tr><td>  And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.</td></tr><tr><td>  All men make faults, and even I in this,</td></tr><tr><td>  Authorizing thy trespass with compare,</td></tr><tr><td>  My self corrupting salving thy amiss,</td></tr><tr><td>  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are:</td></tr><tr><td>  For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy adverse party is thy advocate,</td></tr><tr><td>  And 'gainst my self a lawful plea commence:</td></tr><tr><td>  Such civil war is in my love and hate,</td></tr><tr><td>    That I an accessary needs must be,</td></tr><tr><td>    To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     36</td></tr><tr><td>  Let me confess that we two must be twain,</td></tr><tr><td>  Although our undivided loves are one:</td></tr><tr><td>  So shall those blots that do with me remain,</td></tr><tr><td>  Without thy help, by me be borne alone.</td></tr><tr><td>  In our two loves there is but one respect,</td></tr><tr><td>  Though in our lives a separable spite,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which though it alter not love's sole effect,</td></tr><tr><td>  Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.</td></tr><tr><td>  I may not evermore acknowledge thee,</td></tr><tr><td>  Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,</td></tr><tr><td>  Nor thou with public kindness honour me,</td></tr><tr><td>  Unless thou take that honour from thy name:</td></tr><tr><td>    But do not so, I love thee in such sort,</td></tr><tr><td>    As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     37</td></tr><tr><td>  As a decrepit father takes delight,</td></tr><tr><td>  To see his active child do deeds of youth,</td></tr><tr><td>  So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite</td></tr><tr><td>  Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.</td></tr><tr><td>  For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,</td></tr><tr><td>  Or any of these all, or all, or more</td></tr><tr><td>  Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,</td></tr><tr><td>  I make my love engrafted to this store:</td></tr><tr><td>  So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,</td></tr><tr><td>  Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give,</td></tr><tr><td>  That I in thy abundance am sufficed,</td></tr><tr><td>  And by a part of all thy glory live:</td></tr><tr><td>    Look what is best, that best I wish in thee,</td></tr><tr><td>    This wish I have, then ten times happy me.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     38</td></tr><tr><td>  How can my muse want subject to invent</td></tr><tr><td>  While thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thine own sweet argument, too excellent,</td></tr><tr><td>  For every vulgar paper to rehearse?</td></tr><tr><td>  O give thy self the thanks if aught in me,</td></tr><tr><td>  Worthy perusal stand against thy sight,</td></tr><tr><td>  For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,</td></tr><tr><td>  When thou thy self dost give invention light?</td></tr><tr><td>  Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth</td></tr><tr><td>  Than those old nine which rhymers invocate,</td></tr><tr><td>  And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth</td></tr><tr><td>  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.</td></tr><tr><td>    If my slight muse do please these curious days,</td></tr><tr><td>    The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     39</td></tr><tr><td>  O how thy worth with manners may I sing,</td></tr><tr><td>  When thou art all the better part of me?</td></tr><tr><td>  What can mine own praise to mine own self bring:</td></tr><tr><td>  And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?</td></tr><tr><td>  Even for this, let us divided live,</td></tr><tr><td>  And our dear love lose name of single one,</td></tr><tr><td>  That by this separation I may give:</td></tr><tr><td>  That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone:</td></tr><tr><td>  O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove,</td></tr><tr><td>  Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,</td></tr><tr><td>  To entertain the time with thoughts of love,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive.</td></tr><tr><td>    And that thou teachest how to make one twain,</td></tr><tr><td>    By praising him here who doth hence remain.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     40</td></tr><tr><td>  Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all,</td></tr><tr><td>  What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?</td></tr><tr><td>  No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call,</td></tr><tr><td>  All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:</td></tr><tr><td>  Then if for my love, thou my love receivest,</td></tr><tr><td>  I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest,</td></tr><tr><td>  But yet be blamed, if thou thy self deceivest</td></tr><tr><td>  By wilful taste of what thy self refusest.</td></tr><tr><td>  I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief</td></tr><tr><td>  Although thou steal thee all my poverty:</td></tr><tr><td>  And yet love knows it is a greater grief</td></tr><tr><td>  To bear greater wrong, than hate's known injury.</td></tr><tr><td>    Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,</td></tr><tr><td>    Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     41</td></tr><tr><td>  Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,</td></tr><tr><td>  When I am sometime absent from thy heart,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,</td></tr><tr><td>  For still temptation follows where thou art.</td></tr><tr><td>  Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,</td></tr><tr><td>  Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed.</td></tr><tr><td>  And when a woman woos, what woman's son,</td></tr><tr><td>  Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed?</td></tr><tr><td>  Ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,</td></tr><tr><td>  And chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth,</td></tr><tr><td>  Who lead thee in their riot even there</td></tr><tr><td>  Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:</td></tr><tr><td>    Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,</td></tr><tr><td>    Thine by thy beauty being false to me.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     42</td></tr><tr><td>  That thou hast her it is not all my grief,</td></tr><tr><td>  And yet it may be said I loved her dearly,</td></tr><tr><td>  That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,</td></tr><tr><td>  A loss in love that touches me more nearly.</td></tr><tr><td>  Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her,</td></tr><tr><td>  And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,</td></tr><tr><td>  Suff'ring my friend for my sake to approve her.</td></tr><tr><td>  If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,</td></tr><tr><td>  And losing her, my friend hath found that loss,</td></tr><tr><td>  Both find each other, and I lose both twain,</td></tr><tr><td>  And both for my sake lay on me this cross,</td></tr><tr><td>    But here's the joy, my friend and I are one,</td></tr><tr><td>    Sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     43</td></tr><tr><td>  When most I wink then do mine eyes best see,</td></tr><tr><td>  For all the day they view things unrespected,</td></tr><tr><td>  But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,</td></tr><tr><td>  And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.</td></tr><tr><td>  Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright</td></tr><tr><td>  How would thy shadow's form, form happy show,</td></tr><tr><td>  To the clear day with thy much clearer light,</td></tr><tr><td>  When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!</td></tr><tr><td>  How would (I say) mine eyes be blessed made,</td></tr><tr><td>  By looking on thee in the living day,</td></tr><tr><td>  When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade,</td></tr><tr><td>  Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!</td></tr><tr><td>    All days are nights to see till I see thee,</td></tr><tr><td>    And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     44</td></tr><tr><td>  If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,</td></tr><tr><td>  Injurious distance should not stop my way,</td></tr><tr><td>  For then despite of space I would be brought,</td></tr><tr><td>  From limits far remote, where thou dost stay,</td></tr><tr><td>  No matter then although my foot did stand</td></tr><tr><td>  Upon the farthest earth removed from thee,</td></tr><tr><td>  For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,</td></tr><tr><td>  As soon as think the place where he would be.</td></tr><tr><td>  But ah, thought kills me that I am not thought</td></tr><tr><td>  To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,</td></tr><tr><td>  But that so much of earth and water wrought,</td></tr><tr><td>  I must attend, time's leisure with my moan.</td></tr><tr><td>    Receiving nought by elements so slow,</td></tr><tr><td>    But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     45</td></tr><tr><td>  The other two, slight air, and purging fire,</td></tr><tr><td>  Are both with thee, wherever I abide,</td></tr><tr><td>  The first my thought, the other my desire,</td></tr><tr><td>  These present-absent with swift motion slide.</td></tr><tr><td>  For when these quicker elements are gone</td></tr><tr><td>  In tender embassy of love to thee,</td></tr><tr><td>  My life being made of four, with two alone,</td></tr><tr><td>  Sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy.</td></tr><tr><td>  Until life's composition be recured,</td></tr><tr><td>  By those swift messengers returned from thee,</td></tr><tr><td>  Who even but now come back again assured,</td></tr><tr><td>  Of thy fair health, recounting it to me.</td></tr><tr><td>    This told, I joy, but then no longer glad,</td></tr><tr><td>    I send them back again and straight grow sad.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     46</td></tr><tr><td>  Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,</td></tr><tr><td>  How to divide the conquest of thy sight,</td></tr><tr><td>  Mine eye, my heart thy picture's sight would bar,</td></tr><tr><td>  My heart, mine eye the freedom of that right,</td></tr><tr><td>  My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,</td></tr><tr><td>  (A closet never pierced with crystal eyes)</td></tr><tr><td>  But the defendant doth that plea deny,</td></tr><tr><td>  And says in him thy fair appearance lies.</td></tr><tr><td>  To side this title is impanelled</td></tr><tr><td>  A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,</td></tr><tr><td>  And by their verdict is determined</td></tr><tr><td>  The clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part.</td></tr><tr><td>    As thus, mine eye's due is thy outward part,</td></tr><tr><td>    And my heart's right, thy inward love of heart.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     47</td></tr><tr><td>  Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,</td></tr><tr><td>  And each doth good turns now unto the other,</td></tr><tr><td>  When that mine eye is famished for a look,</td></tr><tr><td>  Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother;</td></tr><tr><td>  With my love's picture then my eye doth feast,</td></tr><tr><td>  And to the painted banquet bids my heart:</td></tr><tr><td>  Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,</td></tr><tr><td>  And in his thoughts of love doth share a part.</td></tr><tr><td>  So either by thy picture or my love,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy self away, art present still with me,</td></tr><tr><td>  For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,</td></tr><tr><td>  And I am still with them, and they with thee.</td></tr><tr><td>    Or if they sleep, thy picture in my sight</td></tr><tr><td>    Awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     48</td></tr><tr><td>  How careful was I when I took my way,</td></tr><tr><td>  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,</td></tr><tr><td>  That to my use it might unused stay</td></tr><tr><td>  From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!</td></tr><tr><td>  But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,</td></tr><tr><td>  Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,</td></tr><tr><td>  Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.</td></tr><tr><td>  Thee have I not locked up in any chest,</td></tr><tr><td>  Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,</td></tr><tr><td>  Within the gentle closure of my breast,</td></tr><tr><td>  From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part,</td></tr><tr><td>    And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear,</td></tr><tr><td>    For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     49</td></tr><tr><td>  Against that time (if ever that time come)</td></tr><tr><td>  When I shall see thee frown on my defects,</td></tr><tr><td>  When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,</td></tr><tr><td>  Called to that audit by advised respects,</td></tr><tr><td>  Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,</td></tr><tr><td>  And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,</td></tr><tr><td>  When love converted from the thing it was</td></tr><tr><td>  Shall reasons find of settled gravity;</td></tr><tr><td>  Against that time do I ensconce me here</td></tr><tr><td>  Within the knowledge of mine own desert,</td></tr><tr><td>  And this my hand, against my self uprear,</td></tr><tr><td>  To guard the lawful reasons on thy part,</td></tr><tr><td>    To leave poor me, thou hast the strength of laws,</td></tr><tr><td>    Since why to love, I can allege no cause.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     50</td></tr><tr><td>  How heavy do I journey on the way,</td></tr><tr><td>  When what I seek (my weary travel's end)</td></tr><tr><td>  Doth teach that case and that repose to say</td></tr><tr><td>  'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.'</td></tr><tr><td>  The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,</td></tr><tr><td>  Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,</td></tr><tr><td>  As if by some instinct the wretch did know</td></tr><tr><td>  His rider loved not speed being made from thee:</td></tr><tr><td>  The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,</td></tr><tr><td>  That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which heavily he answers with a groan,</td></tr><tr><td>  More sharp to me than spurring to his side,</td></tr><tr><td>    For that same groan doth put this in my mind,</td></tr><tr><td>    My grief lies onward and my joy behind.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     51</td></tr><tr><td>  Thus can my love excuse the slow offence,</td></tr><tr><td>  Of my dull bearer, when from thee I speed,</td></tr><tr><td>  From where thou art, why should I haste me thence?</td></tr><tr><td>  Till I return of posting is no need.</td></tr><tr><td>  O what excuse will my poor beast then find,</td></tr><tr><td>  When swift extremity can seem but slow?</td></tr><tr><td>  Then should I spur though mounted on the wind,</td></tr><tr><td>  In winged speed no motion shall I know,</td></tr><tr><td>  Then can no horse with my desire keep pace,</td></tr><tr><td>  Therefore desire (of perfect'st love being made)</td></tr><tr><td>  Shall neigh (no dull flesh) in his fiery race,</td></tr><tr><td>  But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,</td></tr><tr><td>    Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,</td></tr><tr><td>    Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     52</td></tr><tr><td>  So am I as the rich whose blessed key,</td></tr><tr><td>  Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,</td></tr><tr><td>  The which he will not every hour survey,</td></tr><tr><td>  For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.</td></tr><tr><td>  Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,</td></tr><tr><td>  Since seldom coming in that long year set,</td></tr><tr><td>  Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,</td></tr><tr><td>  Or captain jewels in the carcanet.</td></tr><tr><td>  So is the time that keeps you as my chest</td></tr><tr><td>  Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,</td></tr><tr><td>  To make some special instant special-blest,</td></tr><tr><td>  By new unfolding his imprisoned pride.</td></tr><tr><td>    Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,</td></tr><tr><td>    Being had to triumph, being lacked to hope.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     53</td></tr><tr><td>  What is your substance, whereof are you made,</td></tr><tr><td>  That millions of strange shadows on you tend?</td></tr><tr><td>  Since every one, hath every one, one shade,</td></tr><tr><td>  And you but one, can every shadow lend:</td></tr><tr><td>  Describe Adonis and the counterfeit,</td></tr><tr><td>  Is poorly imitated after you,</td></tr><tr><td>  On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,</td></tr><tr><td>  And you in Grecian tires are painted new:</td></tr><tr><td>  Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,</td></tr><tr><td>  The one doth shadow of your beauty show,</td></tr><tr><td>  The other as your bounty doth appear,</td></tr><tr><td>  And you in every blessed shape we know.</td></tr><tr><td>    In all external grace you have some part,</td></tr><tr><td>    But you like none, none you for constant heart.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     54</td></tr><tr><td>  O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem,</td></tr><tr><td>  By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!</td></tr><tr><td>  The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem</td></tr><tr><td>  For that sweet odour, which doth in it live:</td></tr><tr><td>  The canker blooms have full as deep a dye,</td></tr><tr><td>  As the perfumed tincture of the roses,</td></tr><tr><td>  Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly,</td></tr><tr><td>  When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:</td></tr><tr><td>  But for their virtue only is their show,</td></tr><tr><td>  They live unwooed, and unrespected fade,</td></tr><tr><td>  Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so,</td></tr><tr><td>  Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:</td></tr><tr><td>    And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,</td></tr><tr><td>    When that shall fade, my verse distills your truth.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     55</td></tr><tr><td>  Not marble, nor the gilded monuments</td></tr><tr><td>  Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,</td></tr><tr><td>  But you shall shine more bright in these contents</td></tr><tr><td>  Than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time.</td></tr><tr><td>  When wasteful war shall statues overturn,</td></tr><tr><td>  And broils root out the work of masonry,</td></tr><tr><td>  Nor Mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn:</td></tr><tr><td>  The living record of your memory.</td></tr><tr><td>  'Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity</td></tr><tr><td>  Shall you pace forth, your praise shall still find room,</td></tr><tr><td>  Even in the eyes of all posterity</td></tr><tr><td>  That wear this world out to the ending doom.</td></tr><tr><td>    So till the judgment that your self arise,</td></tr><tr><td>    You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     56</td></tr><tr><td>  Sweet love renew thy force, be it not said</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which but to-day by feeding is allayed,</td></tr><tr><td>  To-morrow sharpened in his former might.</td></tr><tr><td>  So love be thou, although to-day thou fill</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,</td></tr><tr><td>  To-morrow see again, and do not kill</td></tr><tr><td>  The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness:</td></tr><tr><td>  Let this sad interim like the ocean be</td></tr><tr><td>  Which parts the shore, where two contracted new,</td></tr><tr><td>  Come daily to the banks, that when they see:</td></tr><tr><td>  Return of love, more blest may be the view.</td></tr><tr><td>    Or call it winter, which being full of care,</td></tr><tr><td>    Makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     57</td></tr><tr><td>  Being your slave what should I do but tend,</td></tr><tr><td>  Upon the hours, and times of your desire?</td></tr><tr><td>  I have no precious time at all to spend;</td></tr><tr><td>  Nor services to do till you require.</td></tr><tr><td>  Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,</td></tr><tr><td>  Whilst I (my sovereign) watch the clock for you,</td></tr><tr><td>  Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,</td></tr><tr><td>  When you have bid your servant once adieu.</td></tr><tr><td>  Nor dare I question with my jealous thought,</td></tr><tr><td>  Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,</td></tr><tr><td>  But like a sad slave stay and think of nought</td></tr><tr><td>  Save where you are, how happy you make those.</td></tr><tr><td>    So true a fool is love, that in your will,</td></tr><tr><td>    (Though you do any thing) he thinks no ill.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     58</td></tr><tr><td>  That god forbid, that made me first your slave,</td></tr><tr><td>  I should in thought control your times of pleasure,</td></tr><tr><td>  Or at your hand th' account of hours to crave,</td></tr><tr><td>  Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure.</td></tr><tr><td>  O let me suffer (being at your beck)</td></tr><tr><td>  Th' imprisoned absence of your liberty,</td></tr><tr><td>  And patience tame to sufferance bide each check,</td></tr><tr><td>  Without accusing you of injury.</td></tr><tr><td>  Be where you list, your charter is so strong,</td></tr><tr><td>  That you your self may privilage your time</td></tr><tr><td>  To what you will, to you it doth belong,</td></tr><tr><td>  Your self to pardon of self-doing crime.</td></tr><tr><td>    I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,</td></tr><tr><td>    Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     59</td></tr><tr><td>  If there be nothing new, but that which is,</td></tr><tr><td>  Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which labouring for invention bear amis</td></tr><tr><td>  The second burthen of a former child!</td></tr><tr><td>  O that record could with a backward look,</td></tr><tr><td>  Even of five hundred courses of the sun,</td></tr><tr><td>  Show me your image in some antique book,</td></tr><tr><td>  Since mind at first in character was done.</td></tr><tr><td>  That I might see what the old world could say,</td></tr><tr><td>  To this composed wonder of your frame,</td></tr><tr><td>  Whether we are mended, or whether better they,</td></tr><tr><td>  Or whether revolution be the same.</td></tr><tr><td>    O sure I am the wits of former days,</td></tr><tr><td>    To subjects worse have given admiring praise.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     60</td></tr><tr><td>  Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,</td></tr><tr><td>  So do our minutes hasten to their end,</td></tr><tr><td>  Each changing place with that which goes before,</td></tr><tr><td>  In sequent toil all forwards do contend.</td></tr><tr><td>  Nativity once in the main of light,</td></tr><tr><td>  Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crowned,</td></tr><tr><td>  Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,</td></tr><tr><td>  And Time that gave, doth now his gift confound.</td></tr><tr><td>  Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth,</td></tr><tr><td>  And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,</td></tr><tr><td>  Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,</td></tr><tr><td>  And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow.</td></tr><tr><td>    And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand</td></tr><tr><td>    Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     61</td></tr><tr><td>  Is it thy will, thy image should keep open</td></tr><tr><td>  My heavy eyelids to the weary night?</td></tr><tr><td>  Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,</td></tr><tr><td>  While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?</td></tr><tr><td>  Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee</td></tr><tr><td>  So far from home into my deeds to pry,</td></tr><tr><td>  To find out shames and idle hours in me,</td></tr><tr><td>  The scope and tenure of thy jealousy?</td></tr><tr><td>  O no, thy love though much, is not so great,</td></tr><tr><td>  It is my love that keeps mine eye awake,</td></tr><tr><td>  Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,</td></tr><tr><td>  To play the watchman ever for thy sake.</td></tr><tr><td>    For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,</td></tr><tr><td>    From me far off, with others all too near.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     62</td></tr><tr><td>  Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye,</td></tr><tr><td>  And all my soul, and all my every part;</td></tr><tr><td>  And for this sin there is no remedy,</td></tr><tr><td>  It is so grounded inward in my heart.</td></tr><tr><td>  Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,</td></tr><tr><td>  No shape so true, no truth of such account,</td></tr><tr><td>  And for my self mine own worth do define,</td></tr><tr><td>  As I all other in all worths surmount.</td></tr><tr><td>  But when my glass shows me my self indeed</td></tr><tr><td>  beated and chopt with tanned antiquity,</td></tr><tr><td>  Mine own self-love quite contrary I read:</td></tr><tr><td>  Self, so self-loving were iniquity.</td></tr><tr><td>    'Tis thee (my self) that for my self I praise,</td></tr><tr><td>    Painting my age with beauty of thy days.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     63</td></tr><tr><td>  Against my love shall be as I am now</td></tr><tr><td>  With Time's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn,</td></tr><tr><td>  When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow</td></tr><tr><td>  With lines and wrinkles, when his youthful morn</td></tr><tr><td>  Hath travelled on to age's steepy night,</td></tr><tr><td>  And all those beauties whereof now he's king</td></tr><tr><td>  Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,</td></tr><tr><td>  Stealing away the treasure of his spring:</td></tr><tr><td>  For such a time do I now fortify</td></tr><tr><td>  Against confounding age's cruel knife,</td></tr><tr><td>  That he shall never cut from memory</td></tr><tr><td>  My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life.</td></tr><tr><td>    His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,</td></tr><tr><td>    And they shall live, and he in them still green.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     64</td></tr><tr><td>  When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced</td></tr><tr><td>  The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age,</td></tr><tr><td>  When sometime lofty towers I see down-rased,</td></tr><tr><td>  And brass eternal slave to mortal rage.</td></tr><tr><td>  When I have seen the hungry ocean gain</td></tr><tr><td>  Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,</td></tr><tr><td>  And the firm soil win of the watery main,</td></tr><tr><td>  Increasing store with loss, and loss with store.</td></tr><tr><td>  When I have seen such interchange of State,</td></tr><tr><td>  Or state it self confounded, to decay,</td></tr><tr><td>  Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate</td></tr><tr><td>  That Time will come and take my love away.</td></tr><tr><td>    This thought is as a death which cannot choose</td></tr><tr><td>    But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     65</td></tr><tr><td>  Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,</td></tr><tr><td>  But sad mortality o'ersways their power,</td></tr><tr><td>  How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,</td></tr><tr><td>  Whose action is no stronger than a flower?</td></tr><tr><td>  O how shall summer's honey breath hold out,</td></tr><tr><td>  Against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days,</td></tr><tr><td>  When rocks impregnable are not so stout,</td></tr><tr><td>  Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays?</td></tr><tr><td>  O fearful meditation, where alack,</td></tr><tr><td>  Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?</td></tr><tr><td>  Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back,</td></tr><tr><td>  Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?</td></tr><tr><td>    O none, unless this miracle have might,</td></tr><tr><td>    That in black ink my love may still shine bright.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     66</td></tr><tr><td>  Tired with all these for restful death I cry,</td></tr><tr><td>  As to behold desert a beggar born,</td></tr><tr><td>  And needy nothing trimmed in jollity,</td></tr><tr><td>  And purest faith unhappily forsworn,</td></tr><tr><td>  And gilded honour shamefully misplaced,</td></tr><tr><td>  And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,</td></tr><tr><td>  And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,</td></tr><tr><td>  And strength by limping sway disabled</td></tr><tr><td>  And art made tongue-tied by authority,</td></tr><tr><td>  And folly (doctor-like) controlling skill,</td></tr><tr><td>  And simple truth miscalled simplicity,</td></tr><tr><td>  And captive good attending captain ill.</td></tr><tr><td>    Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,</td></tr><tr><td>    Save that to die, I leave my love alone.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     67</td></tr><tr><td>  Ah wherefore with infection should he live,</td></tr><tr><td>  And with his presence grace impiety,</td></tr><tr><td>  That sin by him advantage should achieve,</td></tr><tr><td>  And lace it self with his society?</td></tr><tr><td>  Why should false painting imitate his cheek,</td></tr><tr><td>  And steal dead seeming of his living hue?</td></tr><tr><td>  Why should poor beauty indirectly seek,</td></tr><tr><td>  Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?</td></tr><tr><td>  Why should he live, now nature bankrupt is,</td></tr><tr><td>  Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins,</td></tr><tr><td>  For she hath no exchequer now but his,</td></tr><tr><td>  And proud of many, lives upon his gains?</td></tr><tr><td>    O him she stores, to show what wealth she had,</td></tr><tr><td>    In days long since, before these last so bad.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     68</td></tr><tr><td>  Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,</td></tr><tr><td>  When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,</td></tr><tr><td>  Before these bastard signs of fair were born,</td></tr><tr><td>  Or durst inhabit on a living brow:</td></tr><tr><td>  Before the golden tresses of the dead,</td></tr><tr><td>  The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,</td></tr><tr><td>  To live a second life on second head,</td></tr><tr><td>  Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:</td></tr><tr><td>  In him those holy antique hours are seen,</td></tr><tr><td>  Without all ornament, it self and true,</td></tr><tr><td>  Making no summer of another's green,</td></tr><tr><td>  Robbing no old to dress his beauty new,</td></tr><tr><td>    And him as for a map doth Nature store,</td></tr><tr><td>    To show false Art what beauty was of yore.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     69</td></tr><tr><td>  Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view,</td></tr><tr><td>  Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend:</td></tr><tr><td>  All tongues (the voice of souls) give thee that due,</td></tr><tr><td>  Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned,</td></tr><tr><td>  But those same tongues that give thee so thine own,</td></tr><tr><td>  In other accents do this praise confound</td></tr><tr><td>  By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.</td></tr><tr><td>  They look into the beauty of thy mind,</td></tr><tr><td>  And that in guess they measure by thy deeds,</td></tr><tr><td>  Then churls their thoughts (although their eyes were kind)</td></tr><tr><td>  To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:</td></tr><tr><td>    But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,</td></tr><tr><td>    The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     70</td></tr><tr><td>  That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,</td></tr><tr><td>  For slander's mark was ever yet the fair,</td></tr><tr><td>  The ornament of beauty is suspect,</td></tr><tr><td>  A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.</td></tr><tr><td>  So thou be good, slander doth but approve,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy worth the greater being wooed of time,</td></tr><tr><td>  For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,</td></tr><tr><td>  And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.</td></tr><tr><td>  Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days,</td></tr><tr><td>  Either not assailed, or victor being charged,</td></tr><tr><td>  Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,</td></tr><tr><td>  To tie up envy, evermore enlarged,</td></tr><tr><td>    If some suspect of ill masked not thy show,</td></tr><tr><td>    Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     71</td></tr><tr><td>  No longer mourn for me when I am dead,</td></tr><tr><td>  Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell</td></tr><tr><td>  Give warning to the world that I am fled</td></tr><tr><td>  From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:</td></tr><tr><td>  Nay if you read this line, remember not,</td></tr><tr><td>  The hand that writ it, for I love you so,</td></tr><tr><td>  That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,</td></tr><tr><td>  If thinking on me then should make you woe.</td></tr><tr><td>  O if (I say) you look upon this verse,</td></tr><tr><td>  When I (perhaps) compounded am with clay,</td></tr><tr><td>  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;</td></tr><tr><td>  But let your love even with my life decay.</td></tr><tr><td>    Lest the wise world should look into your moan,</td></tr><tr><td>    And mock you with me after I am gone.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     72</td></tr><tr><td>  O lest the world should task you to recite,</td></tr><tr><td>  What merit lived in me that you should love</td></tr><tr><td>  After my death (dear love) forget me quite,</td></tr><tr><td>  For you in me can nothing worthy prove.</td></tr><tr><td>  Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,</td></tr><tr><td>  To do more for me than mine own desert,</td></tr><tr><td>  And hang more praise upon deceased I,</td></tr><tr><td>  Than niggard truth would willingly impart:</td></tr><tr><td>  O lest your true love may seem false in this,</td></tr><tr><td>  That you for love speak well of me untrue,</td></tr><tr><td>  My name be buried where my body is,</td></tr><tr><td>  And live no more to shame nor me, nor you.</td></tr><tr><td>    For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,</td></tr><tr><td>    And so should you, to love things nothing worth.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     73</td></tr><tr><td>  That time of year thou mayst in me behold,</td></tr><tr><td>  When yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang</td></tr><tr><td>  Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,</td></tr><tr><td>  Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.</td></tr><tr><td>  In me thou seest the twilight of such day,</td></tr><tr><td>  As after sunset fadeth in the west,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which by and by black night doth take away,</td></tr><tr><td>  Death's second self that seals up all in rest.</td></tr><tr><td>  In me thou seest the glowing of such fire,</td></tr><tr><td>  That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,</td></tr><tr><td>  As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,</td></tr><tr><td>  Consumed with that which it was nourished by.</td></tr><tr><td>    This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,</td></tr><tr><td>    To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     74</td></tr><tr><td>  But be contented when that fell arrest,</td></tr><tr><td>  Without all bail shall carry me away,</td></tr><tr><td>  My life hath in this line some interest,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.</td></tr><tr><td>  When thou reviewest this, thou dost review,</td></tr><tr><td>  The very part was consecrate to thee,</td></tr><tr><td>  The earth can have but earth, which is his due,</td></tr><tr><td>  My spirit is thine the better part of me,</td></tr><tr><td>  So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,</td></tr><tr><td>  The prey of worms, my body being dead,</td></tr><tr><td>  The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,</td></tr><tr><td>  Too base of thee to be remembered,</td></tr><tr><td>    The worth of that, is that which it contains,</td></tr><tr><td>    And that is this, and this with thee remains.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     75</td></tr><tr><td>  So are you to my thoughts as food to life,</td></tr><tr><td>  Or as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground;</td></tr><tr><td>  And for the peace of you I hold such strife</td></tr><tr><td>  As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found.</td></tr><tr><td>  Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon</td></tr><tr><td>  Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,</td></tr><tr><td>  Now counting best to be with you alone,</td></tr><tr><td>  Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure,</td></tr><tr><td>  Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,</td></tr><tr><td>  And by and by clean starved for a look,</td></tr><tr><td>  Possessing or pursuing no delight</td></tr><tr><td>  Save what is had, or must from you be took.</td></tr><tr><td>    Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,</td></tr><tr><td>    Or gluttoning on all, or all away.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     76</td></tr><tr><td>  Why is my verse so barren of new pride?</td></tr><tr><td>  So far from variation or quick change?</td></tr><tr><td>  Why with the time do I not glance aside</td></tr><tr><td>  To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?</td></tr><tr><td>  Why write I still all one, ever the same,</td></tr><tr><td>  And keep invention in a noted weed,</td></tr><tr><td>  That every word doth almost tell my name,</td></tr><tr><td>  Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?</td></tr><tr><td>  O know sweet love I always write of you,</td></tr><tr><td>  And you and love are still my argument:</td></tr><tr><td>  So all my best is dressing old words new,</td></tr><tr><td>  Spending again what is already spent:</td></tr><tr><td>    For as the sun is daily new and old,</td></tr><tr><td>    So is my love still telling what is told.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     77</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste,</td></tr><tr><td>  These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,</td></tr><tr><td>  And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.</td></tr><tr><td>  The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show,</td></tr><tr><td>  Of mouthed graves will give thee memory,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know,</td></tr><tr><td>  Time's thievish progress to eternity.</td></tr><tr><td>  Look what thy memory cannot contain,</td></tr><tr><td>  Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find</td></tr><tr><td>  Those children nursed, delivered from thy brain,</td></tr><tr><td>  To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.</td></tr><tr><td>    These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,</td></tr><tr><td>    Shall profit thee, and much enrich thy book.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     78</td></tr><tr><td>  So oft have I invoked thee for my muse,</td></tr><tr><td>  And found such fair assistance in my verse,</td></tr><tr><td>  As every alien pen hath got my use,</td></tr><tr><td>  And under thee their poesy disperse.</td></tr><tr><td>  Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing,</td></tr><tr><td>  And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,</td></tr><tr><td>  Have added feathers to the learned's wing,</td></tr><tr><td>  And given grace a double majesty.</td></tr><tr><td>  Yet be most proud of that which I compile,</td></tr><tr><td>  Whose influence is thine, and born of thee,</td></tr><tr><td>  In others' works thou dost but mend the style,</td></tr><tr><td>  And arts with thy sweet graces graced be.</td></tr><tr><td>    But thou art all my art, and dost advance</td></tr><tr><td>    As high as learning, my rude ignorance.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     79</td></tr><tr><td>  Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,</td></tr><tr><td>  My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,</td></tr><tr><td>  But now my gracious numbers are decayed,</td></tr><tr><td>  And my sick muse doth give an other place.</td></tr><tr><td>  I grant (sweet love) thy lovely argument</td></tr><tr><td>  Deserves the travail of a worthier pen,</td></tr><tr><td>  Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent,</td></tr><tr><td>  He robs thee of, and pays it thee again,</td></tr><tr><td>  He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word,</td></tr><tr><td>  From thy behaviour, beauty doth he give</td></tr><tr><td>  And found it in thy cheek: he can afford</td></tr><tr><td>  No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.</td></tr><tr><td>    Then thank him not for that which he doth say,</td></tr><tr><td>    Since what he owes thee, thou thy self dost pay.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     80</td></tr><tr><td>  O how I faint when I of you do write,</td></tr><tr><td>  Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,</td></tr><tr><td>  And in the praise thereof spends all his might,</td></tr><tr><td>  To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame.</td></tr><tr><td>  But since your worth (wide as the ocean is)</td></tr><tr><td>  The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,</td></tr><tr><td>  My saucy bark (inferior far to his)</td></tr><tr><td>  On your broad main doth wilfully appear.</td></tr><tr><td>  Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,</td></tr><tr><td>  Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride,</td></tr><tr><td>  Or (being wrecked) I am a worthless boat,</td></tr><tr><td>  He of tall building, and of goodly pride.</td></tr><tr><td>    Then if he thrive and I be cast away,</td></tr><tr><td>    The worst was this, my love was my decay.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     81</td></tr><tr><td>  Or I shall live your epitaph to make,</td></tr><tr><td>  Or you survive when I in earth am rotten,</td></tr><tr><td>  From hence your memory death cannot take,</td></tr><tr><td>  Although in me each part will be forgotten.</td></tr><tr><td>  Your name from hence immortal life shall have,</td></tr><tr><td>  Though I (once gone) to all the world must die,</td></tr><tr><td>  The earth can yield me but a common grave,</td></tr><tr><td>  When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie,</td></tr><tr><td>  Your monument shall be my gentle verse,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read,</td></tr><tr><td>  And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,</td></tr><tr><td>  When all the breathers of this world are dead,</td></tr><tr><td>    You still shall live (such virtue hath my pen)</td></tr><tr><td>    Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     82</td></tr><tr><td>  I grant thou wert not married to my muse,</td></tr><tr><td>  And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook</td></tr><tr><td>  The dedicated words which writers use</td></tr><tr><td>  Of their fair subject, blessing every book.</td></tr><tr><td>  Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,</td></tr><tr><td>  Finding thy worth a limit past my praise,</td></tr><tr><td>  And therefore art enforced to seek anew,</td></tr><tr><td>  Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.</td></tr><tr><td>  And do so love, yet when they have devised,</td></tr><tr><td>  What strained touches rhetoric can lend,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathized,</td></tr><tr><td>  In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend.</td></tr><tr><td>    And their gross painting might be better used,</td></tr><tr><td>    Where cheeks need blood, in thee it is abused.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     83</td></tr><tr><td>  I never saw that you did painting need,</td></tr><tr><td>  And therefore to your fair no painting set,</td></tr><tr><td>  I found (or thought I found) you did exceed,</td></tr><tr><td>  That barren tender of a poet's debt:</td></tr><tr><td>  And therefore have I slept in your report,</td></tr><tr><td>  That you your self being extant well might show,</td></tr><tr><td>  How far a modern quill doth come too short,</td></tr><tr><td>  Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.</td></tr><tr><td>  This silence for my sin you did impute,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which shall be most my glory being dumb,</td></tr><tr><td>  For I impair not beauty being mute,</td></tr><tr><td>  When others would give life, and bring a tomb.</td></tr><tr><td>    There lives more life in one of your fair eyes,</td></tr><tr><td>    Than both your poets can in praise devise.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     84</td></tr><tr><td>  Who is it that says most, which can say more,</td></tr><tr><td>  Than this rich praise, that you alone, are you?</td></tr><tr><td>  In whose confine immured is the store,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which should example where your equal grew.</td></tr><tr><td>  Lean penury within that pen doth dwell,</td></tr><tr><td>  That to his subject lends not some small glory,</td></tr><tr><td>  But he that writes of you, if he can tell,</td></tr><tr><td>  That you are you, so dignifies his story.</td></tr><tr><td>  Let him but copy what in you is writ,</td></tr><tr><td>  Not making worse what nature made so clear,</td></tr><tr><td>  And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,</td></tr><tr><td>  Making his style admired every where.</td></tr><tr><td>    You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,</td></tr><tr><td>    Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     85</td></tr><tr><td>  My tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still,</td></tr><tr><td>  While comments of your praise richly compiled,</td></tr><tr><td>  Reserve their character with golden quill,</td></tr><tr><td>  And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.</td></tr><tr><td>  I think good thoughts, whilst other write good words,</td></tr><tr><td>  And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen,</td></tr><tr><td>  To every hymn that able spirit affords,</td></tr><tr><td>  In polished form of well refined pen.</td></tr><tr><td>  Hearing you praised, I say 'tis so, 'tis true,</td></tr><tr><td>  And to the most of praise add something more,</td></tr><tr><td>  But that is in my thought, whose love to you</td></tr><tr><td>  (Though words come hindmost) holds his rank before,</td></tr><tr><td>    Then others, for the breath of words respect,</td></tr><tr><td>    Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     86</td></tr><tr><td>  Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,</td></tr><tr><td>  Bound for the prize of (all too precious) you,</td></tr><tr><td>  That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,</td></tr><tr><td>  Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?</td></tr><tr><td>  Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,</td></tr><tr><td>  Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?</td></tr><tr><td>  No, neither he, nor his compeers by night</td></tr><tr><td>  Giving him aid, my verse astonished.</td></tr><tr><td>  He nor that affable familiar ghost</td></tr><tr><td>  Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,</td></tr><tr><td>  As victors of my silence cannot boast,</td></tr><tr><td>  I was not sick of any fear from thence.</td></tr><tr><td>    But when your countenance filled up his line,</td></tr><tr><td>    Then lacked I matter, that enfeebled mine.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     87</td></tr><tr><td>  Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,</td></tr><tr><td>  And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,</td></tr><tr><td>  The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing:</td></tr><tr><td>  My bonds in thee are all determinate.</td></tr><tr><td>  For how do I hold thee but by thy granting,</td></tr><tr><td>  And for that riches where is my deserving?</td></tr><tr><td>  The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,</td></tr><tr><td>  And so my patent back again is swerving.</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,</td></tr><tr><td>  Or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking,</td></tr><tr><td>  So thy great gift upon misprision growing,</td></tr><tr><td>  Comes home again, on better judgement making.</td></tr><tr><td>    Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter,</td></tr><tr><td>    In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     88</td></tr><tr><td>  When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,</td></tr><tr><td>  And place my merit in the eye of scorn,</td></tr><tr><td>  Upon thy side, against my self I'll fight,</td></tr><tr><td>  And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn:</td></tr><tr><td>  With mine own weakness being best acquainted,</td></tr><tr><td>  Upon thy part I can set down a story</td></tr><tr><td>  Of faults concealed, wherein I am attainted:</td></tr><tr><td>  That thou in losing me, shalt win much glory:</td></tr><tr><td>  And I by this will be a gainer too,</td></tr><tr><td>  For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,</td></tr><tr><td>  The injuries that to my self I do,</td></tr><tr><td>  Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.</td></tr><tr><td>    Such is my love, to thee I so belong,</td></tr><tr><td>    That for thy right, my self will bear all wrong.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     89</td></tr><tr><td>  Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,</td></tr><tr><td>  And I will comment upon that offence,</td></tr><tr><td>  Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt:</td></tr><tr><td>  Against thy reasons making no defence.</td></tr><tr><td>  Thou canst not (love) disgrace me half so ill,</td></tr><tr><td>  To set a form upon desired change,</td></tr><tr><td>  As I'll my self disgrace, knowing thy will,</td></tr><tr><td>  I will acquaintance strangle and look strange:</td></tr><tr><td>  Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,</td></tr><tr><td>  Lest I (too much profane) should do it wronk:</td></tr><tr><td>  And haply of our old acquaintance tell.</td></tr><tr><td>    For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,</td></tr><tr><td>    For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     90</td></tr><tr><td>  Then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now,</td></tr><tr><td>  Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross,</td></tr><tr><td>  join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,</td></tr><tr><td>  And do not drop in for an after-loss:</td></tr><tr><td>  Ah do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow,</td></tr><tr><td>  Come in the rearward of a conquered woe,</td></tr><tr><td>  Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,</td></tr><tr><td>  To linger out a purposed overthrow.</td></tr><tr><td>  If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,</td></tr><tr><td>  When other petty griefs have done their spite,</td></tr><tr><td>  But in the onset come, so shall I taste</td></tr><tr><td>  At first the very worst of fortune's might.</td></tr><tr><td>    And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,</td></tr><tr><td>    Compared with loss of thee, will not seem so.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     91</td></tr><tr><td>  Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,</td></tr><tr><td>  Some in their wealth, some in their body's force,</td></tr><tr><td>  Some in their garments though new-fangled ill:</td></tr><tr><td>  Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse.</td></tr><tr><td>  And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,</td></tr><tr><td>  Wherein it finds a joy above the rest,</td></tr><tr><td>  But these particulars are not my measure,</td></tr><tr><td>  All these I better in one general best.</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy love is better than high birth to me,</td></tr><tr><td>  Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' costs,</td></tr><tr><td>  Of more delight than hawks and horses be:</td></tr><tr><td>  And having thee, of all men's pride I boast.</td></tr><tr><td>    Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take,</td></tr><tr><td>    All this away, and me most wretchcd make.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     92</td></tr><tr><td>  But do thy worst to steal thy self away,</td></tr><tr><td>  For term of life thou art assured mine,</td></tr><tr><td>  And life no longer than thy love will stay,</td></tr><tr><td>  For it depends upon that love of thine.</td></tr><tr><td>  Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,</td></tr><tr><td>  When in the least of them my life hath end,</td></tr><tr><td>  I see, a better state to me belongs</td></tr><tr><td>  Than that, which on thy humour doth depend.</td></tr><tr><td>  Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,</td></tr><tr><td>  Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie,</td></tr><tr><td>  O what a happy title do I find,</td></tr><tr><td>  Happy to have thy love, happy to die!</td></tr><tr><td>    But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     93</td></tr><tr><td>  So shall I live, supposing thou art true,</td></tr><tr><td>  Like a deceived husband, so love's face,</td></tr><tr><td>  May still seem love to me, though altered new:</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place.</td></tr><tr><td>  For there can live no hatred in thine eye,</td></tr><tr><td>  Therefore in that I cannot know thy change,</td></tr><tr><td>  In many's looks, the false heart's history</td></tr><tr><td>  Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.</td></tr><tr><td>  But heaven in thy creation did decree,</td></tr><tr><td>  That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell,</td></tr><tr><td>  Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.</td></tr><tr><td>    How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,</td></tr><tr><td>    If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     94</td></tr><tr><td>  They that have power to hurt, and will do none,</td></tr><tr><td>  That do not do the thing, they most do show,</td></tr><tr><td>  Who moving others, are themselves as stone,</td></tr><tr><td>  Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow:</td></tr><tr><td>  They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,</td></tr><tr><td>  And husband nature's riches from expense,</td></tr><tr><td>  Tibey are the lords and owners of their faces,</td></tr><tr><td>  Others, but stewards of their excellence:</td></tr><tr><td>  The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,</td></tr><tr><td>  Though to it self, it only live and die,</td></tr><tr><td>  But if that flower with base infection meet,</td></tr><tr><td>  The basest weed outbraves his dignity:</td></tr><tr><td>    For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,</td></tr><tr><td>    Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     95</td></tr><tr><td>  How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which like a canker in the fragrant rose,</td></tr><tr><td>  Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!</td></tr><tr><td>  O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!</td></tr><tr><td>  That tongue that tells the story of thy days,</td></tr><tr><td>  (Making lascivious comments on thy sport)</td></tr><tr><td>  Cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise,</td></tr><tr><td>  Naming thy name, blesses an ill report.</td></tr><tr><td>  O what a mansion have those vices got,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which for their habitation chose out thee,</td></tr><tr><td>  Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,</td></tr><tr><td>  And all things turns to fair, that eyes can see!</td></tr><tr><td>    Take heed (dear heart) of this large privilege,</td></tr><tr><td>    The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     96</td></tr><tr><td>  Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness,</td></tr><tr><td>  Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport,</td></tr><tr><td>  Both grace and faults are loved of more and less:</td></tr><tr><td>  Thou mak'st faults graces, that to thee resort:</td></tr><tr><td>  As on the finger of a throned queen,</td></tr><tr><td>  The basest jewel will be well esteemed:</td></tr><tr><td>  So are those errors that in thee are seen,</td></tr><tr><td>  To truths translated, and for true things deemed.</td></tr><tr><td>  How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,</td></tr><tr><td>  If like a lamb he could his looks translate!</td></tr><tr><td>  How many gazers mightst thou lead away,</td></tr><tr><td>  if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!</td></tr><tr><td>    But do not so, I love thee in such sort,</td></tr><tr><td>    As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     97</td></tr><tr><td>  How like a winter hath my absence been</td></tr><tr><td>  From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!</td></tr><tr><td>  What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!</td></tr><tr><td>  What old December's bareness everywhere!</td></tr><tr><td>  And yet this time removed was summer's time,</td></tr><tr><td>  The teeming autumn big with rich increase,</td></tr><tr><td>  Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,</td></tr><tr><td>  Like widowed wombs after their lords' decease:</td></tr><tr><td>  Yet this abundant issue seemed to me</td></tr><tr><td>  But hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit,</td></tr><tr><td>  For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,</td></tr><tr><td>  And thou away, the very birds are mute.</td></tr><tr><td>    Or if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,</td></tr><tr><td>    That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     98</td></tr><tr><td>  From you have I been absent in the spring,</td></tr><tr><td>  When proud-pied April (dressed in all his trim)</td></tr><tr><td>  Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing:</td></tr><tr><td>  That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him.</td></tr><tr><td>  Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell</td></tr><tr><td>  Of different flowers in odour and in hue,</td></tr><tr><td>  Could make me any summer's story tell:</td></tr><tr><td>  Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:</td></tr><tr><td>  Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,</td></tr><tr><td>  Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose,</td></tr><tr><td>  They were but sweet, but figures of delight:</td></tr><tr><td>  Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.</td></tr><tr><td>    Yet seemed it winter still, and you away,</td></tr><tr><td>    As with your shadow I with these did play.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     99</td></tr><tr><td>  The forward violet thus did I chide,</td></tr><tr><td>  Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,</td></tr><tr><td>  If not from my love's breath? The purple pride</td></tr><tr><td>  Which on thy soft check for complexion dwells,</td></tr><tr><td>  In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed.</td></tr><tr><td>  The lily I condemned for thy hand,</td></tr><tr><td>  And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair,</td></tr><tr><td>  The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,</td></tr><tr><td>  One blushing shame, another white despair:</td></tr><tr><td>  A third nor red, nor white, had stol'n of both,</td></tr><tr><td>  And to his robbery had annexed thy breath,</td></tr><tr><td>  But for his theft in pride of all his growth</td></tr><tr><td>  A vengeful canker eat him up to death.</td></tr><tr><td>    More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,</td></tr><tr><td>    But sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     100</td></tr><tr><td>  Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long,</td></tr><tr><td>  To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?</td></tr><tr><td>  Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,</td></tr><tr><td>  Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?</td></tr><tr><td>  Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,</td></tr><tr><td>  In gentle numbers time so idly spent,</td></tr><tr><td>  Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem,</td></tr><tr><td>  And gives thy pen both skill and argument.</td></tr><tr><td>  Rise resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,</td></tr><tr><td>  If time have any wrinkle graven there,</td></tr><tr><td>  If any, be a satire to decay,</td></tr><tr><td>  And make time's spoils despised everywhere.</td></tr><tr><td>    Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,</td></tr><tr><td>    So thou prevent'st his scythe, and crooked knife.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     101</td></tr><tr><td>  O truant Muse what shall be thy amends,</td></tr><tr><td>  For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?</td></tr><tr><td>  Both truth and beauty on my love depends:</td></tr><tr><td>  So dost thou too, and therein dignified:</td></tr><tr><td>  Make answer Muse, wilt thou not haply say,</td></tr><tr><td>  'Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed,</td></tr><tr><td>  Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay:</td></tr><tr><td>  But best is best, if never intermixed'?</td></tr><tr><td>  Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?</td></tr><tr><td>  Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee,</td></tr><tr><td>  To make him much outlive a gilded tomb:</td></tr><tr><td>  And to be praised of ages yet to be.</td></tr><tr><td>    Then do thy office Muse, I teach thee how,</td></tr><tr><td>    To make him seem long hence, as he shows now.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     102</td></tr><tr><td>  My love is strengthened though more weak in seeming,</td></tr><tr><td>  I love not less, though less the show appear,</td></tr><tr><td>  That love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming,</td></tr><tr><td>  The owner's tongue doth publish every where.</td></tr><tr><td>  Our love was new, and then but in the spring,</td></tr><tr><td>  When I was wont to greet it with my lays,</td></tr><tr><td>  As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,</td></tr><tr><td>  And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:</td></tr><tr><td>  Not that the summer is less pleasant now</td></tr><tr><td>  Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,</td></tr><tr><td>  But that wild music burthens every bough,</td></tr><tr><td>  And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.</td></tr><tr><td>    Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:</td></tr><tr><td>    Because I would not dull you with my song.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     103</td></tr><tr><td>  Alack what poverty my muse brings forth,</td></tr><tr><td>  That having such a scope to show her pride,</td></tr><tr><td>  The argument all bare is of more worth</td></tr><tr><td>  Than when it hath my added praise beside.</td></tr><tr><td>  O blame me not if I no more can write!</td></tr><tr><td>  Look in your glass and there appears a face,</td></tr><tr><td>  That over-goes my blunt invention quite,</td></tr><tr><td>  Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.</td></tr><tr><td>  Were it not sinful then striving to mend,</td></tr><tr><td>  To mar the subject that before was well?</td></tr><tr><td>  For to no other pass my verses tend,</td></tr><tr><td>  Than of your graces and your gifts to tell.</td></tr><tr><td>    And more, much more than in my verse can sit,</td></tr><tr><td>    Your own glass shows you, when you look in it.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     104</td></tr><tr><td>  To me fair friend you never can be old,</td></tr><tr><td>  For as you were when first your eye I eyed,</td></tr><tr><td>  Such seems your beauty still: three winters cold,</td></tr><tr><td>  Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,</td></tr><tr><td>  Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned,</td></tr><tr><td>  In process of the seasons have I seen,</td></tr><tr><td>  Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,</td></tr><tr><td>  Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green.</td></tr><tr><td>  Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand,</td></tr><tr><td>  Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived,</td></tr><tr><td>  So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand</td></tr><tr><td>  Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived.</td></tr><tr><td>    For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred,</td></tr><tr><td>    Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     105</td></tr><tr><td>  Let not my love be called idolatry,</td></tr><tr><td>  Nor my beloved as an idol show,</td></tr><tr><td>  Since all alike my songs and praises be</td></tr><tr><td>  To one, of one, still such, and ever so.</td></tr><tr><td>  Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,</td></tr><tr><td>  Still constant in a wondrous excellence,</td></tr><tr><td>  Therefore my verse to constancy confined,</td></tr><tr><td>  One thing expressing, leaves out difference.</td></tr><tr><td>  Fair, kind, and true, is all my argument,</td></tr><tr><td>  Fair, kind, and true, varying to other words,</td></tr><tr><td>  And in this change is my invention spent,</td></tr><tr><td>  Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.</td></tr><tr><td>    Fair, kind, and true, have often lived alone.</td></tr><tr><td>    Which three till now, never kept seat in one.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     106</td></tr><tr><td>  When in the chronicle of wasted time,</td></tr><tr><td>  I see descriptions of the fairest wights,</td></tr><tr><td>  And beauty making beautiful old rhyme,</td></tr><tr><td>  In praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights,</td></tr><tr><td>  Then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,</td></tr><tr><td>  Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,</td></tr><tr><td>  I see their antique pen would have expressed,</td></tr><tr><td>  Even such a beauty as you master now.</td></tr><tr><td>  So all their praises are but prophecies</td></tr><tr><td>  Of this our time, all you prefiguring,</td></tr><tr><td>  And for they looked but with divining eyes,</td></tr><tr><td>  They had not skill enough your worth to sing:</td></tr><tr><td>    For we which now behold these present days,</td></tr><tr><td>    Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     107</td></tr><tr><td>  Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul,</td></tr><tr><td>  Of the wide world, dreaming on things to come,</td></tr><tr><td>  Can yet the lease of my true love control,</td></tr><tr><td>  Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.</td></tr><tr><td>  The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,</td></tr><tr><td>  And the sad augurs mock their own presage,</td></tr><tr><td>  Incertainties now crown themselves assured,</td></tr><tr><td>  And peace proclaims olives of endless age.</td></tr><tr><td>  Now with the drops of this most balmy time,</td></tr><tr><td>  My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,</td></tr><tr><td>  Since spite of him I'll live in this poor rhyme,</td></tr><tr><td>  While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes.</td></tr><tr><td>    And thou in this shalt find thy monument,</td></tr><tr><td>    When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     108</td></tr><tr><td>  What's in the brain that ink may character,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit,</td></tr><tr><td>  What's new to speak, what now to register,</td></tr><tr><td>  That may express my love, or thy dear merit?</td></tr><tr><td>  Nothing sweet boy, but yet like prayers divine,</td></tr><tr><td>  I must each day say o'er the very same,</td></tr><tr><td>  Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,</td></tr><tr><td>  Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name.</td></tr><tr><td>  So that eternal love in love's fresh case,</td></tr><tr><td>  Weighs not the dust and injury of age,</td></tr><tr><td>  Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,</td></tr><tr><td>  But makes antiquity for aye his page,</td></tr><tr><td>    Finding the first conceit of love there bred,</td></tr><tr><td>    Where time and outward form would show it dead.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     109</td></tr><tr><td>  O never say that I was false of heart,</td></tr><tr><td>  Though absence seemed my flame to qualify,</td></tr><tr><td>  As easy might I from my self depart,</td></tr><tr><td>  As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:</td></tr><tr><td>  That is my home of love, if I have ranged,</td></tr><tr><td>  Like him that travels I return again,</td></tr><tr><td>  Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,</td></tr><tr><td>  So that my self bring water for my stain,</td></tr><tr><td>  Never believe though in my nature reigned,</td></tr><tr><td>  All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,</td></tr><tr><td>  That it could so preposterously be stained,</td></tr><tr><td>  To leave for nothing all thy sum of good:</td></tr><tr><td>    For nothing this wide universe I call,</td></tr><tr><td>    Save thou my rose, in it thou art my all.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     110</td></tr><tr><td>  Alas 'tis true, I have gone here and there,</td></tr><tr><td>  And made my self a motley to the view,</td></tr><tr><td>  Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,</td></tr><tr><td>  Made old offences of affections new.</td></tr><tr><td>  Most true it is, that I have looked on truth</td></tr><tr><td>  Askance and strangely: but by all above,</td></tr><tr><td>  These blenches gave my heart another youth,</td></tr><tr><td>  And worse essays proved thee my best of love.</td></tr><tr><td>  Now all is done, have what shall have no end,</td></tr><tr><td>  Mine appetite I never more will grind</td></tr><tr><td>  On newer proof, to try an older friend,</td></tr><tr><td>  A god in love, to whom I am confined.</td></tr><tr><td>    Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,</td></tr><tr><td>    Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     111</td></tr><tr><td>  O for my sake do you with Fortune chide,</td></tr><tr><td>  The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,</td></tr><tr><td>  That did not better for my life provide,</td></tr><tr><td>  Than public means which public manners breeds.</td></tr><tr><td>  Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,</td></tr><tr><td>  And almost thence my nature is subdued</td></tr><tr><td>  To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:</td></tr><tr><td>  Pity me then, and wish I were renewed,</td></tr><tr><td>  Whilst like a willing patient I will drink,</td></tr><tr><td>  Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection,</td></tr><tr><td>  No bitterness that I will bitter think,</td></tr><tr><td>  Nor double penance to correct correction.</td></tr><tr><td>    Pity me then dear friend, and I assure ye,</td></tr><tr><td>    Even that your pity is enough to cure me.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     112</td></tr><tr><td>  Your love and pity doth th' impression fill,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow,</td></tr><tr><td>  For what care I who calls me well or ill,</td></tr><tr><td>  So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?</td></tr><tr><td>  You are my all the world, and I must strive,</td></tr><tr><td>  To know my shames and praises from your tongue,</td></tr><tr><td>  None else to me, nor I to none alive,</td></tr><tr><td>  That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong.</td></tr><tr><td>  In so profound abysm I throw all care</td></tr><tr><td>  Of others' voices, that my adder's sense,</td></tr><tr><td>  To critic and to flatterer stopped are:</td></tr><tr><td>  Mark how with my neglect I do dispense.</td></tr><tr><td>    You are so strongly in my purpose bred,</td></tr><tr><td>    That all the world besides methinks are dead.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     113</td></tr><tr><td>  Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind,</td></tr><tr><td>  And that which governs me to go about,</td></tr><tr><td>  Doth part his function, and is partly blind,</td></tr><tr><td>  Seems seeing, but effectually is out:</td></tr><tr><td>  For it no form delivers to the heart</td></tr><tr><td>  Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch,</td></tr><tr><td>  Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,</td></tr><tr><td>  Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:</td></tr><tr><td>  For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight,</td></tr><tr><td>  The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,</td></tr><tr><td>  The mountain, or the sea, the day, or night:</td></tr><tr><td>  The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.</td></tr><tr><td>    Incapable of more, replete with you,</td></tr><tr><td>    My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     114</td></tr><tr><td>  Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you</td></tr><tr><td>  Drink up the monarch's plague this flattery?</td></tr><tr><td>  Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true,</td></tr><tr><td>  And that your love taught it this alchemy?</td></tr><tr><td>  To make of monsters, and things indigest,</td></tr><tr><td>  Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,</td></tr><tr><td>  Creating every bad a perfect best</td></tr><tr><td>  As fast as objects to his beams assemble:</td></tr><tr><td>  O 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing,</td></tr><tr><td>  And my great mind most kingly drinks it up,</td></tr><tr><td>  Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,</td></tr><tr><td>  And to his palate doth prepare the cup.</td></tr><tr><td>    If it be poisoned, 'tis the lesser sin,</td></tr><tr><td>    That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     115</td></tr><tr><td>  Those lines that I before have writ do lie,</td></tr><tr><td>  Even those that said I could not love you dearer,</td></tr><tr><td>  Yet then my judgment knew no reason why,</td></tr><tr><td>  My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer,</td></tr><tr><td>  But reckoning time, whose millioned accidents</td></tr><tr><td>  Creep in 'twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,</td></tr><tr><td>  Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,</td></tr><tr><td>  Divert strong minds to the course of alt'ring things:</td></tr><tr><td>  Alas why fearing of time's tyranny,</td></tr><tr><td>  Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,'</td></tr><tr><td>  When I was certain o'er incertainty,</td></tr><tr><td>  Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?</td></tr><tr><td>    Love is a babe, then might I not say so</td></tr><tr><td>    To give full growth to that which still doth grow.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     116</td></tr><tr><td>  Let me not to the marriage of true minds</td></tr><tr><td>  Admit impediments, love is not love</td></tr><tr><td>  Which alters when it alteration finds,</td></tr><tr><td>  Or bends with the remover to remove.</td></tr><tr><td>  O no, it is an ever-fixed mark</td></tr><tr><td>  That looks on tempests and is never shaken;</td></tr><tr><td>  It is the star to every wand'ring bark,</td></tr><tr><td>  Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.</td></tr><tr><td>  Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks</td></tr><tr><td>  Within his bending sickle's compass come,</td></tr><tr><td>  Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,</td></tr><tr><td>  But bears it out even to the edge of doom:</td></tr><tr><td>    If this be error and upon me proved,</td></tr><tr><td>    I never writ, nor no man ever loved.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     117</td></tr><tr><td>  Accuse me thus, that I have scanted all,</td></tr><tr><td>  Wherein I should your great deserts repay,</td></tr><tr><td>  Forgot upon your dearest love to call,</td></tr><tr><td>  Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day,</td></tr><tr><td>  That I have frequent been with unknown minds,</td></tr><tr><td>  And given to time your own dear-purchased right,</td></tr><tr><td>  That I have hoisted sail to all the winds</td></tr><tr><td>  Which should transport me farthest from your sight.</td></tr><tr><td>  Book both my wilfulness and errors down,</td></tr><tr><td>  And on just proof surmise, accumulate,</td></tr><tr><td>  Bring me within the level of your frown,</td></tr><tr><td>  But shoot not at me in your wakened hate:</td></tr><tr><td>    Since my appeal says I did strive to prove</td></tr><tr><td>    The constancy and virtue of your love.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     118</td></tr><tr><td>  Like as to make our appetite more keen</td></tr><tr><td>  With eager compounds we our palate urge,</td></tr><tr><td>  As to prevent our maladies unseen,</td></tr><tr><td>  We sicken to shun sickness when we purge.</td></tr><tr><td>  Even so being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,</td></tr><tr><td>  To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;</td></tr><tr><td>  And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness,</td></tr><tr><td>  To be diseased ere that there was true needing.</td></tr><tr><td>  Thus policy in love t' anticipate</td></tr><tr><td>  The ills that were not, grew to faults assured,</td></tr><tr><td>  And brought to medicine a healthful state</td></tr><tr><td>  Which rank of goodness would by ill be cured.</td></tr><tr><td>    But thence I learn and find the lesson true,</td></tr><tr><td>    Drugs poison him that so feil sick of you.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     119</td></tr><tr><td>  What potions have I drunk of Siren tears</td></tr><tr><td>  Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within,</td></tr><tr><td>  Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,</td></tr><tr><td>  Still losing when I saw my self to win!</td></tr><tr><td>  What wretched errors hath my heart committed,</td></tr><tr><td>  Whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never!</td></tr><tr><td>  How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted</td></tr><tr><td>  In the distraction of this madding fever!</td></tr><tr><td>  O benefit of ill, now I find true</td></tr><tr><td>  That better is, by evil still made better.</td></tr><tr><td>  And ruined love when it is built anew</td></tr><tr><td>  Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.</td></tr><tr><td>    So I return rebuked to my content,</td></tr><tr><td>    And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     120</td></tr><tr><td>  That you were once unkind befriends me now,</td></tr><tr><td>  And for that sorrow, which I then did feel,</td></tr><tr><td>  Needs must I under my transgression bow,</td></tr><tr><td>  Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel.</td></tr><tr><td>  For if you were by my unkindness shaken</td></tr><tr><td>  As I by yours, y'have passed a hell of time,</td></tr><tr><td>  And I a tyrant have no leisure taken</td></tr><tr><td>  To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.</td></tr><tr><td>  O that our night of woe might have remembered</td></tr><tr><td>  My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,</td></tr><tr><td>  And soon to you, as you to me then tendered</td></tr><tr><td>  The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!</td></tr><tr><td>    But that your trespass now becomes a fee,</td></tr><tr><td>    Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     121</td></tr><tr><td>  'Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,</td></tr><tr><td>  When not to be, receives reproach of being,</td></tr><tr><td>  And the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed,</td></tr><tr><td>  Not by our feeling, but by others' seeing.</td></tr><tr><td>  For why should others' false adulterate eyes</td></tr><tr><td>  Give salutation to my sportive blood?</td></tr><tr><td>  Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which in their wills count bad what I think good?</td></tr><tr><td>  No, I am that I am, and they that level</td></tr><tr><td>  At my abuses, reckon up their own,</td></tr><tr><td>  I may be straight though they themselves be bevel;</td></tr><tr><td>  By their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown</td></tr><tr><td>    Unless this general evil they maintain,</td></tr><tr><td>    All men are bad and in their badness reign.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     122</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain</td></tr><tr><td>  Full charactered with lasting memory,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which shall above that idle rank remain</td></tr><tr><td>  Beyond all date even to eternity.</td></tr><tr><td>  Or at the least, so long as brain and heart</td></tr><tr><td>  Have faculty by nature to subsist,</td></tr><tr><td>  Till each to razed oblivion yield his part</td></tr><tr><td>  Of thee, thy record never can be missed:</td></tr><tr><td>  That poor retention could not so much hold,</td></tr><tr><td>  Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score,</td></tr><tr><td>  Therefore to give them from me was I bold,</td></tr><tr><td>  To trust those tables that receive thee more:</td></tr><tr><td>    To keep an adjunct to remember thee</td></tr><tr><td>    Were to import forgetfulness in me.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     123</td></tr><tr><td>  No! Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy pyramids built up with newer might</td></tr><tr><td>  To me are nothing novel, nothing strange,</td></tr><tr><td>  They are but dressings Of a former sight:</td></tr><tr><td>  Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire,</td></tr><tr><td>  What thou dost foist upon us that is old,</td></tr><tr><td>  And rather make them born to our desire,</td></tr><tr><td>  Than think that we before have heard them told:</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy registers and thee I both defy,</td></tr><tr><td>  Not wond'ring at the present, nor the past,</td></tr><tr><td>  For thy records, and what we see doth lie,</td></tr><tr><td>  Made more or less by thy continual haste:</td></tr><tr><td>    This I do vow and this shall ever be,</td></tr><tr><td>    I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     124</td></tr><tr><td>  If my dear love were but the child of state,</td></tr><tr><td>  It might for Fortune's bastard be unfathered,</td></tr><tr><td>  As subject to time's love or to time's hate,</td></tr><tr><td>  Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered.</td></tr><tr><td>  No it was builded far from accident,</td></tr><tr><td>  It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls</td></tr><tr><td>  Under the blow of thralled discontent,</td></tr><tr><td>  Whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls:</td></tr><tr><td>  It fears not policy that heretic,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which works on leases of short-numbered hours,</td></tr><tr><td>  But all alone stands hugely politic,</td></tr><tr><td>  That it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.</td></tr><tr><td>    To this I witness call the fools of time,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     125</td></tr><tr><td>  Were't aught to me I bore the canopy,</td></tr><tr><td>  With my extern the outward honouring,</td></tr><tr><td>  Or laid great bases for eternity,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which proves more short than waste or ruining?</td></tr><tr><td>  Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour</td></tr><tr><td>  Lose all, and more by paying too much rent</td></tr><tr><td>  For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,</td></tr><tr><td>  Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent?</td></tr><tr><td>  No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,</td></tr><tr><td>  And take thou my oblation, poor but free,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which is not mixed with seconds, knows no art,</td></tr><tr><td>  But mutual render, only me for thee.</td></tr><tr><td>    Hence, thou suborned informer, a true soul</td></tr><tr><td>    When most impeached, stands least in thy control.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     126</td></tr><tr><td>  O thou my lovely boy who in thy power,</td></tr><tr><td>  Dost hold Time's fickle glass his fickle hour:</td></tr><tr><td>  Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.</td></tr><tr><td>  If Nature (sovereign mistress over wrack)</td></tr><tr><td>  As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,</td></tr><tr><td>  She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill</td></tr><tr><td>  May time disgrace, and wretched minutes kill.</td></tr><tr><td>  Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure,</td></tr><tr><td>  She may detain, but not still keep her treasure!</td></tr><tr><td>    Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,</td></tr><tr><td>    And her quietus is to render thee.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     127</td></tr><tr><td>  In the old age black was not counted fair,</td></tr><tr><td>  Or if it were it bore not beauty's name:</td></tr><tr><td>  But now is black beauty's successive heir,</td></tr><tr><td>  And beauty slandered with a bastard shame,</td></tr><tr><td>  For since each hand hath put on nature's power,</td></tr><tr><td>  Fairing the foul with art's false borrowed face,</td></tr><tr><td>  Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower,</td></tr><tr><td>  But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.</td></tr><tr><td>  Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,</td></tr><tr><td>  Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem,</td></tr><tr><td>  At such who not born fair no beauty lack,</td></tr><tr><td>  Slandering creation with a false esteem,</td></tr><tr><td>    Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,</td></tr><tr><td>    That every tongue says beauty should look so.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     128</td></tr><tr><td>  How oft when thou, my music, music play'st,</td></tr><tr><td>  Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds</td></tr><tr><td>  With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st</td></tr><tr><td>  The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,</td></tr><tr><td>  Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap,</td></tr><tr><td>  To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,</td></tr><tr><td>  Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,</td></tr><tr><td>  At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand.</td></tr><tr><td>  To be so tickled they would change their state</td></tr><tr><td>  And situation with those dancing chips,</td></tr><tr><td>  O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,</td></tr><tr><td>  Making dead wood more blest than living lips,</td></tr><tr><td>    Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,</td></tr><tr><td>    Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     129</td></tr><tr><td>  Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame</td></tr><tr><td>  Is lust in action, and till action, lust</td></tr><tr><td>  Is perjured, murd'rous, bloody full of blame,</td></tr><tr><td>  Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,</td></tr><tr><td>  Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight,</td></tr><tr><td>  Past reason hunted, and no sooner

having, and in quest, to have extreme,</td></tr><tr><td>  A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe,</td></tr><tr><td>  Before a joy proposed behind a dream.</td></tr><tr><td>    All this the world well knows yet none knows well,</td></tr><tr><td>    To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     130</td></tr><tr><td>  My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun,</td></tr><tr><td>  Coral is far more red, than her lips red,</td></tr><tr><td>  If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun:</td></tr><tr><td>  If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head:</td></tr><tr><td>  I have seen roses damasked, red and white,</td></tr><tr><td>  But no such roses see I in her cheeks,</td></tr><tr><td>  And in some perfumes is there more delight,</td></tr><tr><td>  Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.</td></tr><tr><td>  I love to hear her speak, yet well I know,</td></tr><tr><td>  That music hath a far more pleasing sound:</td></tr><tr><td>  I grant I never saw a goddess go,</td></tr><tr><td>  My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.</td></tr><tr><td>    And yet by heaven I think my love as rare,</td></tr><tr><td>    As any she belied with false compare.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     131</td></tr><tr><td>  Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,</td></tr><tr><td>  As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;</td></tr><tr><td>  For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart</td></tr><tr><td>  Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.</td></tr><tr><td>  Yet in good faith some say that thee behold,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;</td></tr><tr><td>  To say they err, I dare not be so bold,</td></tr><tr><td>  Although I swear it to my self alone.</td></tr><tr><td>  And to be sure that is not false I swear,</td></tr><tr><td>  A thousand groans but thinking on thy face,</td></tr><tr><td>  One on another's neck do witness bear</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.</td></tr><tr><td>    In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,</td></tr><tr><td>    And thence this slander as I think proceeds.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     132</td></tr><tr><td>  Thine eyes I love, and they as pitying me,</td></tr><tr><td>  Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,</td></tr><tr><td>  Have put on black, and loving mourners be,</td></tr><tr><td>  Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.</td></tr><tr><td>  And truly not the morning sun of heaven</td></tr><tr><td>  Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,</td></tr><tr><td>  Nor that full star that ushers in the even</td></tr><tr><td>  Doth half that glory to the sober west</td></tr><tr><td>  As those two mourning eyes become thy face:</td></tr><tr><td>  O let it then as well beseem thy heart</td></tr><tr><td>  To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,</td></tr><tr><td>  And suit thy pity like in every part.</td></tr><tr><td>    Then will I swear beauty herself is black,</td></tr><tr><td>    And all they foul that thy complexion lack.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     133</td></tr><tr><td>  Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan</td></tr><tr><td>  For that deep wound it gives my friend and me;</td></tr><tr><td>  Is't not enough to torture me alone,</td></tr><tr><td>  But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?</td></tr><tr><td>  Me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken,</td></tr><tr><td>  And my next self thou harder hast engrossed,</td></tr><tr><td>  Of him, my self, and thee I am forsaken,</td></tr><tr><td>  A torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed:</td></tr><tr><td>  Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,</td></tr><tr><td>  But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail,</td></tr><tr><td>  Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol.</td></tr><tr><td>    And yet thou wilt, for I being pent in thee,</td></tr><tr><td>    Perforce am thine and all that is in me.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     134</td></tr><tr><td>  So now I have confessed that he is thine,</td></tr><tr><td>  And I my self am mortgaged to thy will,</td></tr><tr><td>  My self I'll forfeit, so that other mine,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still:</td></tr><tr><td>  But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,</td></tr><tr><td>  For thou art covetous, and he is kind,</td></tr><tr><td>  He learned but surety-like to write for me,</td></tr><tr><td>  Under that bond that him as fist doth bind.</td></tr><tr><td>  The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thou usurer that put'st forth all to use,</td></tr><tr><td>  And sue a friend, came debtor for my sake,</td></tr><tr><td>  So him I lose through my unkind abuse.</td></tr><tr><td>    Him have I lost, thou hast both him and me,</td></tr><tr><td>    He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     135</td></tr><tr><td>  Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,</td></tr><tr><td>  And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in over-plus,</td></tr><tr><td>  More than enough am I that vex thee still,</td></tr><tr><td>  To thy sweet will making addition thus.</td></tr><tr><td>  Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious,</td></tr><tr><td>  Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?</td></tr><tr><td>  Shall will in others seem right gracious,</td></tr><tr><td>  And in my will no fair acceptance shine?</td></tr><tr><td>  The sea all water, yet receives rain still,</td></tr><tr><td>  And in abundance addeth to his store,</td></tr><tr><td>  So thou being rich in will add to thy will</td></tr><tr><td>  One will of mine to make thy large will more.</td></tr><tr><td>    Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill,</td></tr><tr><td>    Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     136</td></tr><tr><td>  If thy soul check thee that I come so near,</td></tr><tr><td>  Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will',</td></tr><tr><td>  And will thy soul knows is admitted there,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thus far for love, my love-suit sweet fulfil.</td></tr><tr><td>  'Will', will fulfil the treasure of thy love,</td></tr><tr><td>  Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one,</td></tr><tr><td>  In things of great receipt with case we prove,</td></tr><tr><td>  Among a number one is reckoned none.</td></tr><tr><td>  Then in the number let me pass untold,</td></tr><tr><td>  Though in thy store's account I one must be,</td></tr><tr><td>  For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold,</td></tr><tr><td>  That nothing me, a something sweet to thee.</td></tr><tr><td>    Make but my name thy love, and love that still,</td></tr><tr><td>    And then thou lov'st me for my name is Will.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     137</td></tr><tr><td>  Thou blind fool Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,</td></tr><tr><td>  That they behold and see not what they see?</td></tr><tr><td>  They know what beauty is, see where it lies,</td></tr><tr><td>  Yet what the best is, take the worst to be.</td></tr><tr><td>  If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks,</td></tr><tr><td>  Be anchored in the bay where all men ride,</td></tr><tr><td>  Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,</td></tr><tr><td>  Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?</td></tr><tr><td>  Why should my heart think that a several plot,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?</td></tr><tr><td>  Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not</td></tr><tr><td>  To put fair truth upon so foul a face?</td></tr><tr><td>    In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,</td></tr><tr><td>    And to this false plague are they now transferred.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     138</td></tr><tr><td>  When my love swears that she is made of truth,</td></tr><tr><td>  I do believe her though I know she lies,</td></tr><tr><td>  That she might think me some untutored youth,</td></tr><tr><td>  Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.</td></tr><tr><td>  Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,</td></tr><tr><td>  Although she knows my days are past the best,</td></tr><tr><td>  Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue,</td></tr><tr><td>  On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:</td></tr><tr><td>  But wherefore says she not she is unjust?</td></tr><tr><td>  And wherefore say not I that I am old?</td></tr><tr><td>  O love's best habit is in seeming trust,</td></tr><tr><td>  And age in love, loves not to have years told.</td></tr><tr><td>    Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,</td></tr><tr><td>    And in our faults by lies we flattered be.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     139</td></tr><tr><td>  O call not me to justify the wrong,</td></tr><tr><td>  That thy unkindness lays upon my heart,</td></tr><tr><td>  Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue,</td></tr><tr><td>  Use power with power, and slay me not by art,</td></tr><tr><td>  Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight,</td></tr><tr><td>  Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside,</td></tr><tr><td>  What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might</td></tr><tr><td>  Is more than my o'erpressed defence can bide?</td></tr><tr><td>  Let me excuse thee, ah my love well knows,</td></tr><tr><td>  Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,</td></tr><tr><td>  And therefore from my face she turns my foes,</td></tr><tr><td>  That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:</td></tr><tr><td>    Yet do not so, but since I am near slain,</td></tr><tr><td>    Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     140</td></tr><tr><td>  Be wise as thou art cruel, do not press</td></tr><tr><td>  My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain:</td></tr><tr><td>  Lest sorrow lend me words and words express,</td></tr><tr><td>  The manner of my pity-wanting pain.</td></tr><tr><td>  If I might teach thee wit better it were,</td></tr><tr><td>  Though not to love, yet love to tell me so,</td></tr><tr><td>  As testy sick men when their deaths be near,</td></tr><tr><td>  No news but health from their physicians know.</td></tr><tr><td>  For if I should despair I should grow mad,</td></tr><tr><td>  And in my madness might speak ill of thee,</td></tr><tr><td>  Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,</td></tr><tr><td>  Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.</td></tr><tr><td>    That I may not be so, nor thou belied,</td></tr><tr><td>    Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     141</td></tr><tr><td>  In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,</td></tr><tr><td>  For they in thee a thousand errors note,</td></tr><tr><td>  But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,</td></tr><tr><td>  Who in despite of view is pleased to dote.</td></tr><tr><td>  Nor are mine cars with thy tongue's tune delighted,</td></tr><tr><td>  Nor tender feeling to base touches prone,</td></tr><tr><td>  Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited</td></tr><tr><td>  To any sensual feast with thee alone:</td></tr><tr><td>  But my five wits, nor my five senses can</td></tr><tr><td>  Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,</td></tr><tr><td>  Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be:</td></tr><tr><td>    Only my plague thus far I count my gain,</td></tr><tr><td>    That she that makes me sin, awards me pain.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     142</td></tr><tr><td>  Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,</td></tr><tr><td>  Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving,</td></tr><tr><td>  O but with mine, compare thou thine own state,</td></tr><tr><td>  And thou shalt find it merits not reproving,</td></tr><tr><td>  Or if it do, not from those lips of thine,</td></tr><tr><td>  That have profaned their scarlet ornaments,</td></tr><tr><td>  And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,</td></tr><tr><td>  Robbed others' beds' revenues of their rents.</td></tr><tr><td>  Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov'st those,</td></tr><tr><td>  Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee,</td></tr><tr><td>  Root pity in thy heart that when it grows,</td></tr><tr><td>  Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.</td></tr><tr><td>    If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,</td></tr><tr><td>    By self-example mayst thou be denied.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     143</td></tr><tr><td>  Lo as a careful huswife runs to catch,</td></tr><tr><td>  One of her feathered creatures broke away,</td></tr><tr><td>  Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch</td></tr><tr><td>  In pursuit of the thing she would have stay:</td></tr><tr><td>  Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,</td></tr><tr><td>  Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent,</td></tr><tr><td>  To follow that which flies before her face:</td></tr><tr><td>  Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;</td></tr><tr><td>  So run'st thou after that which flies from thee,</td></tr><tr><td>  Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind,</td></tr><tr><td>  But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me:</td></tr><tr><td>  And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind.</td></tr><tr><td>    So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will,</td></tr><tr><td>    If thou turn back and my loud crying still.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     144</td></tr><tr><td>  Two loves I have of comfort and despair,</td></tr><tr><td>  Which like two spirits do suggest me still,</td></tr><tr><td>  The better angel is a man right fair:</td></tr><tr><td>  The worser spirit a woman coloured ill.</td></tr><tr><td>  To win me soon to hell my female evil,</td></tr><tr><td>  Tempteth my better angel from my side,</td></tr><tr><td>  And would corrupt my saint to be a devil:</td></tr><tr><td>  Wooing his purity with her foul pride.</td></tr><tr><td>  And whether that my angel be turned fiend,</td></tr><tr><td>  Suspect I may, yet not directly tell,</td></tr><tr><td>  But being both from me both to each friend,</td></tr><tr><td>  I guess one angel in another's hell.</td></tr><tr><td>    Yet this shall I ne'er know but live in doubt,</td></tr><tr><td>    Till my bad angel fire my good one out.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     145</td></tr><tr><td>  Those lips that Love's own hand did make,</td></tr><tr><td>  Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate',</td></tr><tr><td>  To me that languished for her sake:</td></tr><tr><td>  But when she saw my woeful state,</td></tr><tr><td>  Straight in her heart did mercy come,</td></tr><tr><td>  Chiding that tongue that ever sweet,</td></tr><tr><td>  Was used in giving gentle doom:</td></tr><tr><td>  And taught it thus anew to greet:</td></tr><tr><td>  'I hate' she altered with an end,</td></tr><tr><td>  That followed it as gentle day,</td></tr><tr><td>  Doth follow night who like a fiend</td></tr><tr><td>  From heaven to hell is flown away.</td></tr><tr><td>    'I hate', from hate away she threw,</td></tr><tr><td>    And saved my life saying 'not you'.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     146</td></tr><tr><td>  Poor soul the centre of

gay?</td></tr><tr><td>  Why so large cost having so short a lease,</td></tr><tr><td>  Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?</td></tr><tr><td>  Shall worms inheritors of this excess</td></tr><tr><td>  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?</td></tr><tr><td>  Then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss,</td></tr><tr><td>  And let that pine to aggravate thy store;</td></tr><tr><td>  Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;</td></tr><tr><td>  Within be fed, without be rich no more,</td></tr><tr><td>    So shall thou feed on death, that feeds on men,</td></tr><tr><td>    And death once dead, there's no more dying then.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     147</td></tr><tr><td>  My love is as a fever

O how can love's eye be true,</td></tr><tr><td>  That is so vexed with watching and with tears?</td></tr><tr><td>  No marvel then though I mistake my view,</td></tr><tr><td>  The sun it self sees not, till heaven clears.</td></tr><tr><td>    O cunning love, with tears thou keep'st me blind,</td></tr><tr><td>    Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     149</td></tr><tr><td>  Canst thou O cruel, say I love thee not,</td></tr><tr><td>  When I against my self with thee partake?</td></tr><tr><td>  Do I not think on thee when I forgot</td></tr><tr><td>  Am of my self, all-tyrant, for thy sake?</td></tr><tr><td>  Who hateth thee that I do call my friend,</td></tr><tr><td>  On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon,</td></tr><tr><td>  Nay if thou lour'st on me do I not spend</td></tr><tr><td>  Revenge upon my self with present moan?</td></tr><tr><td>  What merit do I in my self respect,</td></tr><tr><td>  That is so proud thy service to despise,</td></tr><tr><td>  When all my best doth worship thy defect,</td></tr><tr><td>  Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?</td></tr><tr><td>    But love hate on for now I know thy mind,</td></tr><tr><td>    Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am blind.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     150</td></tr><tr><td>  O from what power hast thou this powerful might,</td></tr><tr><td>  With insufficiency my heart to sway,</td></tr><tr><td>  To make me give the lie to my true sight,</td></tr><tr><td>  And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?</td></tr><tr><td>  Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,</td></tr><tr><td>  That in the very refuse of thy deeds,</td></tr><tr><td>  There is such strength and warrantise of skill,</td></tr><tr><td>  That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds?</td></tr><tr><td>  Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,</td></tr><tr><td>  The more I hear and see just cause of hate?</td></tr><tr><td>  O though I love what others do abhor,</td></tr><tr><td>  With others thou shouldst not abhor my state.</td></tr><tr><td>    If thy unworthiness raised love in me,</td></tr><tr><td>    More worthy I to be beloved of thee.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     151</td></tr><tr><td>  Love is too young to know what conscience is,</td></tr><tr><td>  Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?</td></tr><tr><td>  Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss,</td></tr><tr><td>  Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove.</td></tr><tr><td>  For thou betraying me, I do betray</td></tr><tr><td>  My nobler part to my gross body's treason,</td></tr><tr><td>  My soul doth tell my body that he may,</td></tr><tr><td>  Triumph in love, flesh stays no farther reason,</td></tr><tr><td>  But rising at thy name doth point out thee,</td></tr><tr><td>  As his triumphant prize, proud of this pride,</td></tr><tr><td>  He is contented thy poor drudge to be,</td></tr><tr><td>  To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.</td></tr><tr><td>    No want of conscience hold it that I call,</td></tr><tr><td>    Her love, for whose dear love I rise and fall.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     152</td></tr><tr><td>  In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,</td></tr><tr><td>  But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing,</td></tr><tr><td>  In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,</td></tr><tr><td>  In vowing new hate after new love bearing:</td></tr><tr><td>  But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,</td></tr><tr><td>  When I break twenty?

SCENE 1.</td></tr><tr><td>Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS OF ROUSILLON, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death anew;</td></tr><tr><td>    but I must attend his Majesty's command, to whom I am now in</td></tr><tr><td>    ward, evermore in subjection.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. You shall find of the King a husband, madam; you, sir, a</td></tr><tr><td>    father. He that so generally is at all times good must of</td></tr><tr><td>    necessity hold his virtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it</td></tr><tr><td>    up where it wanted, rather than lack it where there is such</td></tr><tr><td>    abundance.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. What hope is there of his Majesty's amendment?</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. He hath abandon'd his physicians, madam; under whose</td></tr><tr><td>    practices he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other</td></tr><tr><td>    advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. This young gentlewoman had a father- O, that 'had,' how</td></tr><tr><td>    sad a passage 'tis!-whose skill was almost as great as his</td></tr><tr><td>    honesty; had it stretch'd so far, would have made nature</td></tr><tr><td>    immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would, for</td></tr><tr><td>    the King's sake, he were living! I think it would be the death of</td></tr><tr><td>    the King's disease.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. How call'd you the man you speak of, madam?</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his</td></tr><tr><td>    great right to be so- Gerard de Narbon.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. He was excellent indeed, madam; the King very lately spoke</td></tr><tr><td>    of him admiringly and mourningly; he was skilful enough to have</td></tr><tr><td>    liv'd still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. What is it, my good lord, the King languishes of?</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. A fistula, my lord.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. I heard not of it before.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the</td></tr><tr><td>    daughter of Gerard de Narbon?</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my</td></tr><tr><td>    overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that her education</td></tr><tr><td>    promises; her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts</td></tr><tr><td>    fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities,</td></tr><tr><td>    there commendations go with pity-they are virtues and traitors</td></tr><tr><td>    too. In her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives</td></tr><tr><td>    her honesty, and achieves her goodness.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. 'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in.</td></tr><tr><td>    The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the</td></tr><tr><td>    tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. No</td></tr><tr><td>    more of this, Helena; go to, no more, lest it be rather thought</td></tr><tr><td>    you affect a sorrow than to have-</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead: excessive</td></tr><tr><td>    grief the enemy to the living.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it</td></tr><tr><td>    soon mortal.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Madam, I desire your holy wishes.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. How understand we that?</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father</td></tr><tr><td>    In manners, as in shape! Thy blood and virtue</td></tr><tr><td>    Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness</td></tr><tr><td>    Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,</td></tr><tr><td>    Do wrong to none; be able for thine enemy</td></tr><tr><td>    Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend</td></tr><tr><td>    Under thy own life's key; be check'd for silence,</td></tr><tr><td>    But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,</td></tr><tr><td>    That thee may furnish, and my prayers pluck down,</td></tr><tr><td>    Fall on thy head! Farewell. My lord,</td></tr><tr><td>    'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,</td></tr><tr><td>    Advise him.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. He cannot want the best</td></tr><tr><td>    That shall attend his love.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.            Exit</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. The best wishes that can be forg'd in your thoughts be</td></tr><tr><td>    servants to you!  [To HELENA]  Be comfortable to my mother, your</td></tr><tr><td>    mistress, and make much of her.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Farewell, pretty lady; you must hold the credit of your</td></tr><tr><td>    father.                             Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. O, were that all! I think not on my father;</td></tr><tr><td>    And these great tears grace his remembrance more</td></tr><tr><td>    Than those I shed for him. What was he like?</td></tr><tr><td>    I have forgot him; my imagination</td></tr><tr><td>    Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.</td></tr><tr><td>    I am undone; there is no living, none,</td></tr><tr><td>    If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one</td></tr><tr><td>    That I should love a bright particular star</td></tr><tr><td>    And think to wed it, he is so above me.</td></tr><tr><td>    In his bright radiance and collateral light</td></tr><tr><td>    Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.</td></tr><tr><td>    Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself:</td></tr><tr><td>    The hind that would be mated by the lion</td></tr><tr><td>    Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,</td></tr><tr><td>    To see him every hour; to sit and draw</td></tr><tr><td>    His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,</td></tr><tr><td>    In our heart's table-heart too capable</td></tr><tr><td>    Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.</td></tr><tr><td>    But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy</td></tr><tr><td>    Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                       Enter PAROLLES</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>    [Aside]  One that goes with him. I love him for his sake;</td></tr><tr><td>    And yet I know him a notorious liar,</td></tr><tr><td>    Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;</td></tr><tr><td>    Yet these fix'd evils sit so fit in him</td></tr><tr><td>    That they take place when virtue's steely bones</td></tr><tr><td>    Looks bleak i' th' cold wind; withal, full oft we see</td></tr><tr><td>    Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Save you, fair queen!</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. And you, monarch!</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. No.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. And no.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Are you meditating on virginity?</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask you a</td></tr><tr><td>    question. Man is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it</td></tr><tr><td>    against him?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Keep him out.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant in the</td></tr><tr><td>    defence, yet is weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. There is none. Man, setting down before you, will</td></tr><tr><td>    undermine you and blow you up.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers-up!</td></tr><tr><td>    Is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown</td></tr><tr><td>    up; marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves</td></tr><tr><td>     made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth</td></tr><tr><td>    of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational</td></tr><tr><td>    increase; and there was never virgin got till virginity was first</td></tr><tr><td>    lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity</td></tr><tr><td>    by being once lost may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it</td></tr><tr><td>    is ever lost. 'Tis too cold a companion; away with't.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a</td></tr><tr><td>    virgin.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the rule</td></tr><tr><td>    of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your</td></tr><tr><td>    mothers; which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs</td></tr><tr><td>    himself is a virgin; virginity murders itself, and should be</td></tr><tr><td>    buried in highways, out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate</td></tr><tr><td>    offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a</td></tr><tr><td>    cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with</td></tr><tr><td>    feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud,</td></tr><tr><td>    idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the</td></tr><tr><td>    canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by't. Out with't.</td></tr><tr><td>    Within ten year it will make itself ten, which is a goodly</td></tr><tr><td>    increase; and the principal itself not much the worse. Away</td></tr><tr><td>    with't.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Let me see. Marry, ill to like him that ne'er it likes.</td></tr><tr><td>    'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept,</td></tr><tr><td>    the less worth. Off with't while 'tis vendible; answer the time</td></tr><tr><td>    of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of</td></tr><tr><td>    fashion, richly suited but unsuitable; just like the brooch and</td></tr><tr><td>    the toothpick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your</td></tr><tr><td>    pie and your porridge than in your cheek. And your virginity,</td></tr><tr><td>    your old virginity, is like one of our French wither'd pears: it</td></tr><tr><td>    looks ill, it eats drily; marry, 'tis a wither'd pear; it was</td></tr><tr><td>    formerly better; marry, yet 'tis a wither'd pear. Will you</td></tr><tr><td>    anything with it?</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Not my virginity yet.</td></tr><tr><td>    There shall your master have a thousand loves,</td></tr><tr><td>    A mother, and a mistress, and a friend,</td></tr><tr><td>    A phoenix, captain, and an enemy,</td></tr><tr><td>    A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,</td></tr><tr><td>    A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;</td></tr><tr><td>    His humble ambition, proud humility,</td></tr><tr><td>    His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,</td></tr><tr><td>    His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world</td></tr><tr><td>    Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms</td></tr><tr><td>    That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he-</td></tr><tr><td>    I know not what he shall. God send him well!</td></tr><tr><td>    The court's a learning-place, and he is one-</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. What one, i' faith?</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. That I wish well. 'Tis pity-</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. What's pity?</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. That wishing well had not a body in't</td></tr><tr><td>    Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,</td></tr><tr><td>    Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,</td></tr><tr><td>    Might with effects of them follow our friends</td></tr><tr><td>    And show what we alone must think, which never</td></tr><tr><td>    Returns us thanks.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                      Enter PAGE</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  PAGE. Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.      Exit PAGE</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I will</td></tr><tr><td>    think of thee at court.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Under Mars, I.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. I especially think, under Mars.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Why under Man?</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. The wars hath so kept you under that you must needs be born</td></tr><tr><td>    under Mars.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. When he was predominant.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. When he was retrograde, I think, rather.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Why think you so?</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. You go so much backward when you fight.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. That's for advantage.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. So is running away, when fear proposes the safety: but the</td></tr><tr><td>    composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of</td></tr><tr><td>    a good wing, and I like the wear well.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. I am so full of business I cannot answer thee acutely. I</td></tr><tr><td>    will return perfect courtier; in the which my instruction shall</td></tr><tr><td>    serve to naturalize thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's</td></tr><tr><td>    counsel, and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee; else</td></tr><tr><td>    thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes</td></tr><tr><td>    thee away. Farewell. When thou hast leisure, say thy prayers;</td></tr><tr><td>    when thou hast none, remember thy friends. Get thee a good</td></tr><tr><td>    husband and use him as he uses thee. So, farewell.</td></tr><tr><td> Exit</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which we ascribe to heaven. The fated sky</td></tr><tr><td>    Gives us free scope; only doth backward pull</td></tr><tr><td>    Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.</td></tr><tr><td>    What power is it which mounts my love so high,</td></tr><tr><td>    That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?</td></tr><tr><td>    The mightiest space in fortune nature brings</td></tr><tr><td>    To join like likes, and kiss like native things.</td></tr><tr><td>    Impossible be strange attempts to those</td></tr><tr><td>    That weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose</td></tr><tr><td>    What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove</td></tr><tr><td>    To show her merit that did miss her love?</td></tr><tr><td>    The King's disease-my project may deceive me,</td></tr><tr><td>    But my intents are fix'd, and will not leave me.        Exit</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>ACT I. SCENE 2.</td></tr><tr><td>Paris. The KING'S palace</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING OF FRANCE, with letters,</td></tr><tr><td>and divers ATTENDANTS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  KING. The Florentines and Senoys are by th' ears;</td></tr><tr><td>    Have fought with equal fortune, and continue</td></tr><tr><td>    A braving war.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. So 'tis reported, sir.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Nay, 'tis most credible. We here receive it,</td></tr><tr><td>    A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,</td></tr><tr><td>    With caution, that the Florentine will move us</td></tr><tr><td>    For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend</td></tr><tr><td>    Prejudicates the business, and would seem</td></tr><tr><td>    To have us make denial.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. His love and wisdom,</td></tr><tr><td>    Approv'd so to your Majesty, may plead</td></tr><tr><td>    For amplest credence.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. He hath arm'd our answer,</td></tr><tr><td>    And Florence is denied before he comes;</td></tr><tr><td>    Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see</td></tr><tr><td>    The Tuscan service, freely have they leave</td></tr><tr><td>    To stand on either part.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. It well may serve</td></tr><tr><td>    A nursery to our gentry, who are sick</td></tr><tr><td>    For breathing and exploit.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. What's he comes here?</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>              Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,</td></tr><tr><td>    Young Bertram.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;</td></tr><tr><td>    Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,</td></tr><tr><td>    Hath well compos'd thee. Thy father's moral parts</td></tr><tr><td>    Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. My thanks and duty are your Majesty's.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. I would I had that corporal soundness now,</td></tr><tr><td>    As when thy father and myself in friendship</td></tr><tr><td>    First tried our soldiership. He did look far</td></tr><tr><td>    Into the service of the time, and was</td></tr><tr><td>    Discipled of the bravest. He lasted long;</td></tr><tr><td>    But on us both did haggish age steal on,</td></tr><tr><td>    And wore us out of act. It much repairs me</td></tr><tr><td>    To talk of your good father. In his youth</td></tr><tr><td>    He had the wit which I can well observe</td></tr><tr><td>    To-day in our young lords; but they may jest</td></tr><tr><td>    Till their own scorn return to them unnoted</td></tr><tr><td>    Ere they can hide their levity in honour.</td></tr><tr><td>    So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness</td></tr><tr><td>    Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,</td></tr><tr><td>    His equal had awak'd them; and his honour,</td></tr><tr><td>    Clock to itself, knew the true minute when</td></tr><tr><td>    Exception bid him speak, and at this time</td></tr><tr><td>    His tongue obey'd his hand. Who were below him</td></tr><tr><td>    He us'd as creatures of another place;</td></tr><tr><td>    And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,</td></tr><tr><td>    Making them proud of his humility</td></tr><tr><td>    In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man</td></tr><tr><td>    Might be a copy to these younger times;</td></tr><tr><td>    Which, followed well, would demonstrate them now</td></tr><tr><td>    But goers backward.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. His good remembrance, sir,</td></tr><tr><td>    Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;</td></tr><tr><td>    So in approof lives not his epitaph</td></tr><tr><td>    As in your royal speech.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Would I were with him! He would always say-</td></tr><tr><td>    Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words</td></tr><tr><td>    He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them</td></tr><tr><td>    To grow there, and to bear- 'Let me not live'-</td></tr><tr><td>    This his good melancholy oft began,</td></tr><tr><td>    On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,</td></tr><tr><td>    When it was out-'Let me not live' quoth he</td></tr><tr><td>    'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff</td></tr><tr><td>    Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses</td></tr><tr><td>    All but new things disdain; whose judgments are</td></tr><tr><td>    Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies</td></tr><tr><td>    Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd.</td></tr><tr><td>    I, after him, do after him wish too,</td></tr><tr><td>    Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,</td></tr><tr><td>    I quickly were dissolved from my hive,</td></tr><tr><td>    To give some labourers room.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. You're loved, sir;</td></tr><tr><td>    They that least lend it you shall lack you first.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. I fill a place, I know't. How long is't, Count,</td></tr><tr><td>    Since the physician at your father's died?</td></tr><tr><td>    He was much fam'd.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Some six months since, my lord.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. If he were living, I would try him yet-</td></tr><tr><td>    Lend me an arm-the rest have worn me out</td></tr><tr><td>    With several applications. Nature and sickness</td></tr><tr><td>    Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, Count;</td></tr><tr><td>    My son's no dearer.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Thank your Majesty.                 Exeunt [Flourish]</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>ACT I. SCENE 3.</td></tr><tr><td>Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Enter COUNTESS, STEWARD, and CLOWN</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?</td></tr><tr><td>  STEWARD. Madam, the care I have had to even your content I wish</td></tr><tr><td>    might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours; for then we</td></tr><tr><td>    wound our modesty, and make foul the clearness of our deservings,</td></tr><tr><td>    when of ourselves we publish them.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah. The</td></tr><tr><td>    complaints I have heard of you I do not all believe; 'tis my</td></tr><tr><td>    slowness that I do not, for I know you lack not folly to commit</td></tr><tr><td>    them and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. 'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Well, sir.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though many of</td></tr><tr><td>    the rich are damn'd; but if I may have your ladyship's good will</td></tr><tr><td>    to go to the world, Isbel the woman and I will do as we may.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Wilt thou needs be a beggar?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. I do beg your good will in this case.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. In what case?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no heritage; and I</td></tr><tr><td>    think I shall never have the blessing of God till I have issue o'</td></tr><tr><td>    my body; for they say bames are blessings.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. My poor body, madam, requires it. I am driven on by the</td></tr><tr><td>    flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Is this all your worship's reason?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such as they are.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. May the world know them?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh</td></tr><tr><td>    and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry that I may repent.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. I am out o' friends, madam, and I hope to have friends for</td></tr><tr><td>    my wife's sake.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Such friends are thine enemies, knave.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. Y'are shallow, madam-in great friends; for the knaves come</td></tr><tr><td>    to do that for me which I am aweary of. He that ears my land</td></tr><tr><td>    spares my team, and gives me leave to in the crop. If I be his</td></tr><tr><td>    cuckold, he's my drudge. He that comforts my wife is the</td></tr><tr><td>    cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh and</td></tr><tr><td>    blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh and blood</td></tr><tr><td>    is my friend; ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend. If men</td></tr><tr><td>    could be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in</td></tr><tr><td>    marriage; for young Charbon the puritan and old Poysam the</td></tr><tr><td>    papist, howsome'er their hearts are sever'd in religion, their</td></tr><tr><td>    heads are both one; they may jowl horns together like any deer</td></tr><tr><td>    i' th' herd.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouth'd and calumnious knave?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next way:</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>              For I the ballad will repeat,</td></tr><tr><td>                Which men full true shall find:</td></tr><tr><td>              Your marriage comes by destiny,</td></tr><tr><td>                Your cuckoo sings by kind.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Get you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon.</td></tr><tr><td>  STEWARD. May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you.</td></tr><tr><td>    Of her I am to speak.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her; Helen</td></tr><tr><td>    I mean.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN.  [Sings]</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>               'Was this fair face the cause' quoth she</td></tr><tr><td>                 'Why the Grecians sacked Troy?</td></tr><tr><td>               Fond done, done fond,</td></tr><tr><td>                 Was this King Priam's joy?'</td></tr><tr><td>               With that she sighed as she stood,</td></tr><tr><td>               With that she sighed as she stood,</td></tr><tr><td>                 And gave this sentence then:</td></tr><tr><td>               'Among nine bad if one be good,</td></tr><tr><td>               Among nine bad if one be good,</td></tr><tr><td>                 There's yet one good in ten.'</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. What, one good in ten? You corrupt the song, sirrah.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. One good woman in ten, madam, which is a purifying o' th'</td></tr><tr><td>    song. Would God would serve the world so all the year! We'd find</td></tr><tr><td>    no fault with the tithe-woman, if I were the parson. One in ten,</td></tr><tr><td>    quoth 'a! An we might have a good woman born before every blazing</td></tr><tr><td>    star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery well: a man</td></tr><tr><td>    may draw his heart out ere 'a pluck one.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. That man should be at woman's command, and yet no hurt done!</td></tr><tr><td>    Though honesty be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will</td></tr><tr><td>    wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart.</td></tr><tr><td>    I am going, forsooth. The business is for Helen to come hither.</td></tr><tr><td> Exit</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Well, now.</td></tr><tr><td>  STEWARD. I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Faith I do. Her father bequeath'd her to me; and she</td></tr><tr><td>    herself, without other advantage, may lawfully make title to as</td></tr><tr><td>    much love as she finds. There is more owing her than is paid; and</td></tr><tr><td>    more shall be paid her than she'll demand.</td></tr><tr><td>  STEWARD. Madam, I was very late more near her than I think she</td></tr><tr><td>    wish'd me. Alone she was, and did communicate to herself her own</td></tr><tr><td>    words to her own ears; she thought, I dare vow for her, they</td></tr><tr><td>    touch'd not any stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your</td></tr><tr><td>    son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such</td></tr><tr><td>    difference betwixt their two estates; Love no god, that would not</td></tr><tr><td>    extend his might only where qualities were level; Diana no queen</td></tr><tr><td>    of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surpris'd without</td></tr><tr><td>    rescue in the first assault, or ransom afterward. This she</td></tr><tr><td>    deliver'd in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e'er I heard</td></tr><tr><td>    virgin exclaim in; which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you</td></tr><tr><td>    withal; sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns you</td></tr><tr><td>    something to know it.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. YOU have discharg'd this honestly; keep it to yourself.</td></tr><tr><td>    Many likelihoods inform'd me of this before, which hung so</td></tr><tr><td>    tott'ring in the balance that I could neither believe nor</td></tr><tr><td>    misdoubt. Pray you leave me. Stall this in your bosom; and I</td></tr><tr><td>    thank you for your honest care. I will speak with you further</td></tr><tr><td>    anon.                                           Exit STEWARD</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                            Enter HELENA</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>    Even so it was with me when I was young.</td></tr><tr><td>    If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn</td></tr><tr><td>    Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;</td></tr><tr><td>    Our blood to us, this to our blood is born.</td></tr><tr><td>    It is the show and seal of nature's truth,</td></tr><tr><td>    Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth.</td></tr><tr><td>    By our remembrances of days foregone,</td></tr><tr><td>    Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.</td></tr><tr><td>    Her eye is sick on't; I observe her now.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. What is your pleasure, madam?</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. You know, Helen,</td></tr><tr><td>    I am a mother to you.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Mine honourable mistress.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Nay, a mother.</td></tr><tr><td>    Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother,'</td></tr><tr><td>    Methought you saw a serpent. What's in 'mother'</td></tr><tr><td>    That you start at it? I say I am your mother,</td></tr><tr><td>    And put you in the catalogue of those</td></tr><tr><td>    That were enwombed mine. 'Tis often seen</td></tr><tr><td>    Adoption strives with nature, and choice breeds</td></tr><tr><td>    A native slip to us from foreign seeds.</td></tr><tr><td>    You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,</td></tr><tr><td>    Yet I express to you a mother's care.</td></tr><tr><td>    God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood</td></tr><tr><td>    To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,</td></tr><tr><td>    That this distempered messenger of wet,</td></tr><tr><td>    The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?</td></tr><tr><td>    Why, that you are my daughter?</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. That I am not.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. I say I am your mother.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Pardon, madam.</td></tr><tr><td>    The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:</td></tr><tr><td>    I am from humble, he from honoured name;</td></tr><tr><td>    No note upon my parents, his all noble.</td></tr><tr><td>    My master, my dear lord he is; and I</td></tr><tr><td>    His servant live, and will his vassal die.</td></tr><tr><td>    He must not be my brother.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Nor I your mother?</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. You are my mother, madam; would you were-</td></tr><tr><td>    So that my lord your son were not my brother-</td></tr><tr><td>    Indeed my mother! Or were you both our mothers,</td></tr><tr><td>    I care no more for than I do for heaven,</td></tr><tr><td>    So I were not his sister. Can't no other,</td></tr><tr><td>    But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law.</td></tr><tr><td>    God shield you mean it not! 'daughter' and 'mother'</td></tr><tr><td>    So strive upon your pulse. What! pale again?</td></tr><tr><td>    My fear hath catch'd your fondness. Now I see</td></tr><tr><td>    The myst'ry of your loneliness, and find</td></tr><tr><td>    Your salt tears' head. Now to all sense 'tis gross</td></tr><tr><td>    You love my son; invention is asham'd,</td></tr><tr><td>    Against the proclamation of thy passion,</td></tr><tr><td>    To say thou dost not. Therefore tell me true;</td></tr><tr><td>    But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look, thy cheeks</td></tr><tr><td>    Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes</td></tr><tr><td>    See it so grossly shown in thy behaviours</td></tr><tr><td>    That in their kind they speak it; only sin</td></tr><tr><td>    And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,</td></tr><tr><td>    That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?</td></tr><tr><td>    If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;</td></tr><tr><td>    If it be not, forswear't; howe'er, I charge thee,</td></tr><tr><td>    As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,</td></tr><tr><td>    To tell me truly.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Good madam, pardon me.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Do you love my son?</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Your pardon, noble mistress.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Love you my son?</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Do not you love him, madam?</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Go not about; my love hath in't a bond</td></tr><tr><td>    Whereof the world takes note. Come, come, disclose</td></tr><tr><td>    The state of your affection; for your passions</td></tr><tr><td>    Have to the full appeach'd.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Then I confess,</td></tr><tr><td>    Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,</td></tr><tr><td>    That before you, and next unto high heaven,</td></tr><tr><td>    I love your son.</td></tr><tr><td>    My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love.</td></tr><tr><td>    Be not offended, for it hurts not him</td></tr><tr><td>    That he is lov'd of me; I follow him not</td></tr><tr><td>    By any token of presumptuous suit,</td></tr><tr><td>    Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;</td></tr><tr><td>    Yet never know how that desert should be.</td></tr><tr><td>    I know I love in vain, strive against hope;</td></tr><tr><td>    Yet in this captious and intenible sieve</td></tr><tr><td>    I still pour in the waters of my love,</td></tr><tr><td>    And lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like,</td></tr><tr><td>    Religious in mine error, I adore</td></tr><tr><td>    The sun that looks upon his worshipper</td></tr><tr><td>    But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,</td></tr><tr><td>    Let not your hate encounter with my love,</td></tr><tr><td>    For loving where you do; but if yourself,</td></tr><tr><td>    Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,</td></tr><tr><td>    Did ever in so true a flame of liking</td></tr><tr><td>    Wish chastely and love dearly that your Dian</td></tr><tr><td>    Was both herself and Love; O, then, give pity</td></tr><tr><td>    To her whose state is such that cannot choose</td></tr><tr><td>    But lend and give where she is sure to lose;</td></tr><tr><td>    That seeks not to find that her search implies,</td></tr><tr><td>    But, riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies!</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Had you not lately an intent-speak truly-</td></tr><tr><td>    To go to Paris?</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Madam, I had.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Wherefore? Tell true.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.</td></tr><tr><td>    You know my father left me some prescriptions</td></tr><tr><td>    Of rare and prov'd effects, such as his reading</td></tr><tr><td>    And manifest experience had collected</td></tr><tr><td>    For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me</td></tr><tr><td>    In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,</td></tr><tr><td>    As notes whose faculties inclusive were</td></tr><tr><td>    More than they were in note. Amongst the rest</td></tr><tr><td>    There is a remedy, approv'd, set down,</td></tr><tr><td>    To cure the desperate languishings whereof</td></tr><tr><td>    The King is render'd lost.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. This was your motive</td></tr><tr><td>    For Paris, was it? Speak.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. My lord your son made me to think of this,</td></tr><tr><td>    Else Paris, and the medicine, and the King,</td></tr><tr><td>    Had from the conversation of my thoughts</td></tr><tr><td>    Haply been absent then.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. But think you, Helen,</td></tr><tr><td>    If you should tender your supposed aid,</td></tr><tr><td>    He would receive it? He and his physicians</td></tr><tr><td>    Are of a mind: he, that they cannot help him;</td></tr><tr><td>    They, that they cannot help. How shall they credit</td></tr><tr><td>    A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,</td></tr><tr><td>    Embowell'd of their doctrine, have let off</td></tr><tr><td>    The danger to itself?</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. There's something in't</td></tr><tr><td>    More than my father's skill, which was the great'st</td></tr><tr><td>    Of his profession, that his good receipt</td></tr><tr><td>    Shall for my legacy be sanctified</td></tr><tr><td>    By th' luckiest stars in heaven; and, would your honour</td></tr><tr><td>    But give me leave to try success, I'd venture</td></tr><tr><td>    The well-lost life of mine on his Grace's cure.</td></tr><tr><td>    By such a day and hour.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Dost thou believe't?</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Ay, madam, knowingly.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,</td></tr><tr><td>    Means and attendants, and my loving greetings</td></tr><tr><td>    To those of mine in court. I'll stay at home,</td></tr><tr><td>    And pray God's blessing into thy attempt.</td></tr><tr><td>    Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,</td></tr><tr><td>    What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.

SCENE 1.</td></tr><tr><td>Paris. The KING'S palace</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING with divers young LORDS taking leave</td></tr><tr><td>for the Florentine war; BERTRAM and PAROLLES; ATTENDANTS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Farewell, young lords; these war-like principles</td></tr><tr><td>    Do not throw from you. And you, my lords, farewell;</td></tr><tr><td>    Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain all,</td></tr><tr><td>    The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis receiv'd,</td></tr><tr><td>    And is enough for both.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. 'Tis our hope, sir,</td></tr><tr><td>    After well-ent'red soldiers, to return</td></tr><tr><td>    And find your Grace in health.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart</td></tr><tr><td>    Will not confess he owes the malady</td></tr><tr><td>    That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;</td></tr><tr><td>    Whether I live or die, be you the sons</td></tr><tr><td>    Of worthy Frenchmen; let higher Italy-</td></tr><tr><td>    Those bated that inherit but the fall</td></tr><tr><td>    Of the last monarchy-see that you come</td></tr><tr><td>    Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when</td></tr><tr><td>    The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,</td></tr><tr><td>    That fame may cry you aloud. I say farewell.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. Health, at your bidding, serve your Majesty!</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Those girls of Italy, take heed of them;</td></tr><tr><td>    They say our French lack language to deny,</td></tr><tr><td>    If they demand; beware of being captives</td></tr><tr><td>    Before you serve.</td></tr><tr><td>    BOTH. Our hearts receive your warnings.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Farewell.  [To ATTENDANTS]  Come hither to me.</td></tr><tr><td>                                       The KING retires attended</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. O my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. 'Tis not his fault, the spark.</td></tr><tr><td>    SECOND LORD. O, 'tis brave wars!</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Most admirable! I have seen those wars.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. I am commanded here and kept a coil with</td></tr><tr><td>    'Too young' and next year' and \"Tis too early.'</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. An thy mind stand to 't, boy, steal away bravely.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,</td></tr><tr><td>    Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,</td></tr><tr><td>    Till honour be bought up, and no sword worn</td></tr><tr><td>    But one to dance with. By heaven, I'll steal away.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. There's honour in the theft.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Commit it, Count.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. I am your accessary; and so farewell.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. I grow to you, and our parting is a tortur'd body.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. Farewell, Captain.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. Sweet Monsieur Parolles!</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good sparks and</td></tr><tr><td>    lustrous, a word, good metals: you shall find in the regiment of</td></tr><tr><td>    the Spinii one Captain Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of</td></tr><tr><td>    war, here on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword</td></tr><tr><td>    entrench'd it. Say to him I live; and observe his reports for me.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. We shall, noble Captain.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Mars dote on you for his novices!       Exeunt LORDS</td></tr><tr><td>    What will ye do?</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                            Re-enter the KING</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Stay; the King!</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Use a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords; you have</td></tr><tr><td>    restrain'd yourself within the list of too cold an adieu. Be more</td></tr><tr><td>    expressive to them; for they wear themselves in the cap of the</td></tr><tr><td>    time; there do muster true gait; eat, speak, and move, under the</td></tr><tr><td>    influence of the most receiv'd star; and though the devil lead</td></tr><tr><td>    the measure, such are to be followed. After them, and take a more</td></tr><tr><td>    dilated farewell.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. And I will do so.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Worthy fellows; and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.</td></tr><tr><td>                                     Exeunt BERTRAM and PAROLLES</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                              Enter LAFEU</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU.  [Kneeling]  Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. I'll fee thee to stand up.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Then here's a man stands that has brought his pardon.</td></tr><tr><td>    I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy;</td></tr><tr><td>    And that at my bidding you could so stand up.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,</td></tr><tr><td>    And ask'd thee mercy for't.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Good faith, across!</td></tr><tr><td>    But, my good lord, 'tis thus: will you be cur'd</td></tr><tr><td>    Of your infirmity?</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. No.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. O, will you eat</td></tr><tr><td>    No grapes, my royal fox? Yes, but you will</td></tr><tr><td>    My noble grapes, an if my royal fox</td></tr><tr><td>    Could reach them: I have seen a medicine</td></tr><tr><td>    That's able to breathe life into a stone,</td></tr><tr><td>    Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary</td></tr><tr><td>    With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch</td></tr><tr><td>    Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,</td></tr><tr><td>    To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand</td></tr><tr><td>    And write to her a love-line.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. What her is this?</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Why, Doctor She! My lord, there's one arriv'd,</td></tr><tr><td>    If you will see her. Now, by my faith and honour,</td></tr><tr><td>    If seriously I may convey my thoughts</td></tr><tr><td>    In this my light deliverance, I have spoke</td></tr><tr><td>    With one that in her sex, her years, profession,</td></tr><tr><td>    Wisdom, and constancy, hath amaz'd me more</td></tr><tr><td>    Than I dare blame my weakness. Will you see her,</td></tr><tr><td>    For that is her demand, and know her business?</td></tr><tr><td>    That done, laugh well at me.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Now, good Lafeu,</td></tr><tr><td>    Bring in the admiration, that we with the</td></tr><tr><td>    May spend our wonder too, or take off thine</td></tr><tr><td>    By wond'ring how thou took'st it.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Nay, I'll fit you,</td></tr><tr><td>    And not be all day neither.                       Exit LAFEU</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                   Re-enter LAFEU with HELENA</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Nay, come your ways.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. This haste hath wings indeed.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Nay, come your ways;</td></tr><tr><td>    This is his Majesty; say your mind to him.</td></tr><tr><td>    A traitor you do look like; but such traitors</td></tr><tr><td>    His Majesty seldom fears. I am Cressid's uncle,</td></tr><tr><td>    That dare leave two together. Fare you well.            Exit</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Now, fair one, does your business follow us?</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Ay, my good lord.</td></tr><tr><td>    Gerard de Narbon was my father,</td></tr><tr><td>    In what he did profess, well found.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. I knew him.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. The rather will I spare my praises towards him;</td></tr><tr><td>    Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death</td></tr><tr><td>    Many receipts he gave me; chiefly one,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which, as the dearest issue of his practice,</td></tr><tr><td>    And of his old experience th' only darling,</td></tr><tr><td>    He bade me store up as a triple eye,</td></tr><tr><td>    Safer than mine own two, more dear. I have so:</td></tr><tr><td>    And, hearing your high Majesty is touch'd</td></tr><tr><td>    With that malignant cause wherein the honour</td></tr><tr><td>    Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,</td></tr><tr><td>    I come to tender it, and my appliance,</td></tr><tr><td>    With all bound humbleness.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. We thank you, maiden;</td></tr><tr><td>    But may not be so credulous of cure,</td></tr><tr><td>    When our most learned doctors leave us, and</td></tr><tr><td>    The congregated college have concluded</td></tr><tr><td>    That labouring art can never ransom nature</td></tr><tr><td>    From her inaidable estate-I say we must not</td></tr><tr><td>    So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,</td></tr><tr><td>    To prostitute our past-cure malady</td></tr><tr><td>    To empirics; or to dissever so</td></tr><tr><td>    Our great self and our credit to esteem</td></tr><tr><td>    A senseless help, when help past sense we deem.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. My duty then shall pay me for my pains.</td></tr><tr><td>    I will no more enforce mine office on you;</td></tr><tr><td>    Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts</td></tr><tr><td>    A modest one to bear me back again.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful.</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give</td></tr><tr><td>    As one near death to those that wish him live.</td></tr><tr><td>    But what at full I know, thou know'st no part;</td></tr><tr><td>    I knowing all my peril, thou no art.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. What I can do can do no hurt to try,</td></tr><tr><td>    Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.</td></tr><tr><td>    He that of greatest works is finisher</td></tr><tr><td>    Oft does them by the weakest minister.</td></tr><tr><td>    So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,</td></tr><tr><td>    When judges have been babes. Great floods have flown</td></tr><tr><td>    From simple sources, and great seas have dried</td></tr><tr><td>    When miracles have by the greatest been denied.</td></tr><tr><td>    Oft expectation fails, and most oft there</td></tr><tr><td>    Where most it promises; and oft it hits</td></tr><tr><td>    Where hope is coldest, and despair most fits.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. I must not hear thee. Fare thee well, kind maid;</td></tr><tr><td>    Thy pains, not us'd, must by thyself be paid;</td></tr><tr><td>    Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd.</td></tr><tr><td>    It is not so with Him that all things knows,</td></tr><tr><td>    As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;</td></tr><tr><td>    But most it is presumption in us when</td></tr><tr><td>    The help of heaven we count the act of men.</td></tr><tr><td>    Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;</td></tr><tr><td>    Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.</td></tr><tr><td>    I am not an impostor, that proclaim</td></tr><tr><td>    Myself against the level of mine aim;</td></tr><tr><td>    But know I think, and think I know most sure,</td></tr><tr><td>    My art is not past power nor you past cure.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Art thou so confident? Within what space</td></tr><tr><td>    Hop'st thou my cure?</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. The greatest Grace lending grace.</td></tr><tr><td>    Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring</td></tr><tr><td>    Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,</td></tr><tr><td>    Ere twice in murk and occidental damp</td></tr><tr><td>    Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,</td></tr><tr><td>    Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass</td></tr><tr><td>    Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,</td></tr><tr><td>    What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,</td></tr><tr><td>    Health shall live free, and sickness freely die.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Upon thy certainty and confidence</td></tr><tr><td>    What dar'st thou venture?</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Tax of impudence,</td></tr><tr><td>    A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame,</td></tr><tr><td>    Traduc'd by odious ballads; my maiden's name</td></tr><tr><td>    Sear'd otherwise; ne worse of worst-extended</td></tr><tr><td>    With vilest torture let my life be ended.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak</td></tr><tr><td>    His powerful sound within an organ weak;</td></tr><tr><td>    And what impossibility would slay</td></tr><tr><td>    In common sense, sense saves another way.</td></tr><tr><td>    Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate</td></tr><tr><td>    Worth name of life in thee hath estimate:</td></tr><tr><td>    Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all</td></tr><tr><td>    That happiness and prime can happy call.</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou this to hazard needs must intimate</td></tr><tr><td>    Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.</td></tr><tr><td>    Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,</td></tr><tr><td>    That ministers thine own death if I die.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. If I break time, or flinch in property</td></tr><tr><td>    Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die;</td></tr><tr><td>    And well deserv'd. Not helping, death's my fee;</td></tr><tr><td>    But, if I help, what do you promise me?</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Make thy demand.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. But will you make it even?</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand</td></tr><tr><td>    What husband in thy power I will command.</td></tr><tr><td>    Exempted be from me the arrogance</td></tr><tr><td>    To choose from forth the royal blood of France,</td></tr><tr><td>    My low and humble name to propagate</td></tr><tr><td>    With any branch or image of thy state;</td></tr><tr><td>    But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know</td></tr><tr><td>    Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Here is my hand; the premises observ'd,</td></tr><tr><td>    Thy will by my performance shall be serv'd.</td></tr><tr><td>    So make the choice of thy own time, for I,</td></tr><tr><td>    Thy resolv'd patient, on thee still rely.</td></tr><tr><td>    More should I question thee, and more I must,</td></tr><tr><td>    Though more to know could not be more to trust,</td></tr><tr><td>    From whence thou cam'st, how tended on. But rest</td></tr><tr><td>    Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.</td></tr><tr><td>    Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed</td></tr><tr><td>    As high as word, my deed shall match thy deed.</td></tr><tr><td>                                              [Flourish. Exeunt]</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>ACT II. SCENE 2.</td></tr><tr><td>Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Enter COUNTESS and CLOWN</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of your</td></tr><tr><td>    breeding.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught. I know my</td></tr><tr><td>    business is but to the court.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. To the court! Why, what place make you special, when you</td></tr><tr><td>    put off that with such contempt? But to the court!</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he may</td></tr><tr><td>    easily put it off at court. He that cannot make a leg, put off's</td></tr><tr><td>    cap, kiss his hand, and say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip,</td></tr><tr><td>    nor cap; and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for</td></tr><tr><td>    the court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all men.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all questions.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. It is like a barber's chair, that fits all buttocks-the pin</td></tr><tr><td>    buttock, the quatch buttock, the brawn buttock, or any buttock.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Will your answer serve fit to all questions?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your</td></tr><tr><td>    French crown for your taffety punk, as Tib's rush for Tom's</td></tr><tr><td>    forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove Tuesday, a morris for Mayday,</td></tr><tr><td>    as the nail to his hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding</td></tr><tr><td>    quean to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the friar's</td></tr><tr><td>    mouth; nay, as the pudding to his skin.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Have you, I, say, an answer of such fitness for all</td></tr><tr><td>    questions?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. From below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit</td></tr><tr><td>    any question.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. It must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit</td></tr><tr><td>    all demands.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should</td></tr><tr><td>    speak truth of it. Here it is, and all that belongs to't. Ask me</td></tr><tr><td>    if I am a courtier: it shall do you no harm to learn.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. To be young again, if we could, I will be a fool in</td></tr><tr><td>    question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I pray you, sir,</td></tr><tr><td>    are you a courtier?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-There's a simple putting off. More, more, a</td></tr><tr><td>    hundred of them.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Thick, thick; spare not me.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. You were lately whipp'd, sir, as I think.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Spare not me.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Do you cry 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and 'spare</td></tr><tr><td>    not me'? Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!' is very sequent to your</td></tr><tr><td>    whipping. You would answer very well to a whipping, if you were</td></tr><tr><td>    but bound to't.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord, sir!' I see</td></tr><tr><td>    thing's may serve long, but not serve ever.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. I play the noble housewife with the time,</td></tr><tr><td>    To entertain it so merrily with a fool.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Why, there't serves well again.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. An end, sir! To your business: give Helen this,</td></tr><tr><td>    And urge her to a present answer back;</td></tr><tr><td>    Commend me to my kinsmen and my son. This is not much.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. Not much commendation to them?</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Not much employment for you. You understand me?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. Most fruitfully; I am there before my legs.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Haste you again.                              Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>ACT II. SCENE 3.</td></tr><tr><td>Paris. The KING'S palace</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. They say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical</td></tr><tr><td>    persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and</td></tr><tr><td>    causeless. Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors,</td></tr><tr><td>    ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should submit</td></tr><tr><td>    ourselves to an unknown fear.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot</td></tr><tr><td>    out in our latter times.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. And so 'tis.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. To be relinquish'd of the artists-</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. So I say-both of Galen and Paracelsus.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Of all the learned and authentic fellows-</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Right; so I say.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. That gave him out incurable-</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Why, there 'tis; so say I too.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Not to be help'd-</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Right; as 'twere a man assur'd of a-</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Uncertain life and sure death.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Just; you say well; so would I have said.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. I may truly say it is a novelty to the world.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. It is indeed. If you will have it in showing, you shall</td></tr><tr><td>    read it in what-do-ye-call't here.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU.  [Reading the ballad title]  'A Showing of a Heavenly</td></tr><tr><td>    Effect in an Earthly Actor.'</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. That's it; I would have said the very same.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Why, your dolphin is not lustier. 'Fore me, I speak in</td></tr><tr><td>    respect-</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Nay, 'tis strange, 'tis very strange; that is the brief</td></tr><tr><td>    and the tedious of it; and he's of a most facinerious spirit that</td></tr><tr><td>    will not acknowledge it to be the-</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Very hand of heaven.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Ay; so I say.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. In a most weak-</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. And debile minister, great power, great transcendence;</td></tr><tr><td>    which should, indeed, give us a further use to be made than alone</td></tr><tr><td>    the recov'ry of the King, as to be-</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Generally thankful.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                 Enter KING, HELENA, and ATTENDANTS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the King.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Lustig, as the Dutchman says. I'll like a maid the better,</td></tr><tr><td>    whilst I have a tooth in my head. Why, he's able to lead her a</td></tr><tr><td>    coranto.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Mort du vinaigre! Is not this Helen?</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. 'Fore God, I think so.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Go, call before me all the lords in court.</td></tr><tr><td>                                               Exit an ATTENDANT</td></tr><tr><td>    Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side;</td></tr><tr><td>    And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou has repeal'd, a second time receive</td></tr><tr><td>    The confirmation of my promis'd gift,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which but attends thy naming.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                     Enter three or four LORDS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>    Fair maid, send forth thine eye. This youthful parcel</td></tr><tr><td>    Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,</td></tr><tr><td>    O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice</td></tr><tr><td>    I have to use. Thy frank election make;</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress</td></tr><tr><td>    Fall, when love please. Marry, to each but one!</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. I'd give bay Curtal and his furniture</td></tr><tr><td>    My mouth no more were broken than these boys',</td></tr><tr><td>    And writ as little beard.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Peruse them well.</td></tr><tr><td>    Not one of those but had a noble father.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Gentlemen,</td></tr><tr><td>    Heaven hath through me restor'd the King to health.</td></tr><tr><td>  ALL. We understand it, and thank heaven for you.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest</td></tr><tr><td>    That I protest I simply am a maid.</td></tr><tr><td>    Please it your Majesty, I have done already.</td></tr><tr><td>    The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me:</td></tr><tr><td>    'We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,</td></tr><tr><td>    Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever,</td></tr><tr><td>    We'll ne'er come there again.'</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Make choice and see:</td></tr><tr><td>    Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,</td></tr><tr><td>    And to imperial Love, that god most high,</td></tr><tr><td>    Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. And grant it.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my</td></tr><tr><td>    life.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,</td></tr><tr><td>    Before I speak, too threat'ningly replies.</td></tr><tr><td>    Love make your fortunes twenty times above</td></tr><tr><td>    Her that so wishes, and her humble love!</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. No better, if you please.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. My wish receive,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which great Love grant; and so I take my leave.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine I'd have</td></tr><tr><td>    them whipt; or I would send them to th' Turk to make eunuchs of.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Be not afraid that I your hand should take;</td></tr><tr><td>    I'll never do you wrong for your own sake.</td></tr><tr><td>    Blessing upon your vows; and in your bed</td></tr><tr><td>    Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. These boys are boys of ice; they'll none have her.</td></tr><tr><td>    Sure, they are bastards to the English; the French ne'er got 'em.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. You are too young, too happy, and too good,</td></tr><tr><td>    To make yourself a son out of my blood.</td></tr><tr><td>  FOURTH LORD. Fair one, I think not so.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk wine-but</td></tr><tr><td>    if thou be'st not an ass, I am a youth of fourteen; I have known</td></tr><tr><td>    thee already.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA.  [To BERTRAM]  I dare not say I take you; but I give</td></tr><tr><td>    Me and my service, ever whilst I live,</td></tr><tr><td>    Into your guiding power. This is the man.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your Highness,</td></tr><tr><td>    In such a business give me leave to use</td></tr><tr><td>    The help of mine own eyes.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Know'st thou not, Bertram,</td></tr><tr><td>    What she has done for me?</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Yes, my good lord;</td></tr><tr><td>    But never hope to know why I should marry her.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Thou know'st she has rais'd me from my sickly bed.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. But follows it, my lord, to bring me down</td></tr><tr><td>    Must answer for your raising? I know her well:</td></tr><tr><td>    She had her breeding at my father's charge.</td></tr><tr><td>    A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain</td></tr><tr><td>    Rather corrupt me ever!</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. 'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which</td></tr><tr><td>    I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,</td></tr><tr><td>    Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,</td></tr><tr><td>    Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off</td></tr><tr><td>    In differences so mighty. If she be</td></tr><tr><td>    All that is virtuous-save what thou dislik'st,</td></tr><tr><td>    A poor physician's daughter-thou dislik'st</td></tr><tr><td>    Of virtue for the name; but do not so.</td></tr><tr><td>    From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,</td></tr><tr><td>    The place is dignified by the doer's deed;</td></tr><tr><td>    Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,</td></tr><tr><td>    It is a dropsied honour. Good alone</td></tr><tr><td>    Is good without a name. Vileness is so:</td></tr><tr><td>    The property by what it is should go,</td></tr><tr><td>    Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;</td></tr><tr><td>    In these to nature she's immediate heir;</td></tr><tr><td>    And these breed honour. That is honour's scorn</td></tr><tr><td>    Which challenges itself as honour's born</td></tr><tr><td>    And is not like the sire. Honours thrive</td></tr><tr><td>    When rather from our acts we them derive</td></tr><tr><td>    Than our fore-goers. The mere word's a slave,</td></tr><tr><td>    Debauch'd on every tomb, on every grave</td></tr><tr><td>    A lying trophy; and as oft is dumb</td></tr><tr><td>    Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb</td></tr><tr><td>    Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?</td></tr><tr><td>    If thou canst like this creature as a maid,</td></tr><tr><td>    I can create the rest. Virtue and she</td></tr><tr><td>    Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. I cannot love her, nor will strive to do 't.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. That you are well restor'd, my lord, I'm glad.</td></tr><tr><td>    Let the rest go.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,</td></tr><tr><td>    I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,</td></tr><tr><td>    Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift,</td></tr><tr><td>    That dost in vile misprision shackle up</td></tr><tr><td>    My love and her desert; that canst not dream</td></tr><tr><td>    We, poising us in her defective scale,</td></tr><tr><td>    Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know</td></tr><tr><td>    It is in us to plant thine honour where</td></tr><tr><td>    We please to have it grow. Check thy contempt;</td></tr><tr><td>    Obey our will, which travails in thy good;</td></tr><tr><td>    Believe not thy disdain, but presently</td></tr><tr><td>    Do thine own fortunes that obedient right</td></tr><tr><td>    Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;</td></tr><tr><td>    Or I will throw thee from my care for ever</td></tr><tr><td>    Into the staggers and the careless lapse</td></tr><tr><td>    Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate</td></tr><tr><td>    Loosing upon thee in the name of justice,</td></tr><tr><td>    Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit</td></tr><tr><td>    My fancy to your eyes. When I consider</td></tr><tr><td>    What great creation and what dole of honour</td></tr><tr><td>    Flies where you bid it, I find that she which late</td></tr><tr><td>    Was in my nobler thoughts most base is now</td></tr><tr><td>    The praised of the King; who, so ennobled,</td></tr><tr><td>    Is as 'twere born so.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Take her by the hand,</td></tr><tr><td>    And tell her she is thine; to whom I promise</td></tr><tr><td>    A counterpoise, if not to thy estate</td></tr><tr><td>    A balance more replete.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. I take her hand.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Good fortune and the favour of the King</td></tr><tr><td>    Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony</td></tr><tr><td>    Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,</td></tr><tr><td>    And be perform'd to-night. The solemn feast</td></tr><tr><td>    Shall more attend upon the coming space,</td></tr><tr><td>    Expecting absent friends. As thou lov'st her,</td></tr><tr><td>    Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.</td></tr><tr><td>              Exeunt all but LAFEU and PAROLLES who stay behind,</td></tr><tr><td>                                      commenting of this wedding</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Do you hear, monsieur? A word with you.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Your pleasure, sir?</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Your lord and master did well to make his recantation.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Recantation! My Lord! my master!</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Ay; is it not a language I speak?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. A most harsh one, and not to be understood without bloody</td></tr><tr><td>    succeeding. My master!</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. To any count; to all counts; to what is man.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. To what is count's man: count's master is of another style.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too</td></tr><tr><td>    old.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which title age</td></tr><tr><td>    cannot bring thee.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. What I dare too well do, I dare not do.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty wise</td></tr><tr><td>    fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel; it might</td></tr><tr><td>    pass. Yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly</td></tr><tr><td>    dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden. I</td></tr><tr><td>    have now found thee; when I lose thee again I care not; yet art</td></tr><tr><td>    thou good for nothing but taking up; and that thou'rt scarce</td></tr><tr><td>    worth.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee-</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy</td></tr><tr><td>    trial; which if-Lord have mercy on thee for a hen! So, my good</td></tr><tr><td>    window of lattice, fare thee well; thy casement I need not open,</td></tr><tr><td>    for I look through thee. Give me thy hand.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. I have not, my lord, deserv'd it.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Yes, good faith, ev'ry dram of it; and I will not bate thee</td></tr><tr><td>    a scruple.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Well, I shall be wiser.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Ev'n as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack</td></tr><tr><td>    o' th' contrary. If ever thou be'st bound in thy scarf and</td></tr><tr><td>    beaten, thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I</td></tr><tr><td>    have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee, or rather my</td></tr><tr><td>    knowledge, that I may say in the default 'He is a man I know.'</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. I would it were hell pains for thy sake, and my poor doing</td></tr><tr><td>    eternal; for doing I am past, as I will by thee, in what motion</td></tr><tr><td>    age will give me leave.                                 Exit</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me:</td></tr><tr><td>    scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must be patient; there</td></tr><tr><td>    is no fettering of authority. I'll beat him, by my life, if I can</td></tr><tr><td>    meet him with any convenience, an he were double and double a</td></tr><tr><td>    lord. I'll have no more pity of his age than I would have of-</td></tr><tr><td>    I'll beat him, and if I could but meet him again.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                         Re-enter LAFEU</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Sirrah, your lord and master's married; there's news for</td></tr><tr><td>    you; you have a new mistress.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some</td></tr><tr><td>    reservation of your wrongs. He is my good lord: whom I serve</td></tr><tr><td>    above is my master.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Who? God?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Ay, sir.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou garter up</td></tr><tr><td>    thy arms o' this fashion? Dost make hose of thy sleeves? Do other</td></tr><tr><td>    servants so? Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose</td></tr><tr><td>    stands. By mine honour, if I were but two hours younger, I'd beat</td></tr><tr><td>    thee. Methink'st thou art a general offence, and every man should</td></tr><tr><td>    beat thee. I think thou wast created for men to breathe</td></tr><tr><td>    themselves upon thee.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel</td></tr><tr><td>    out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond, and no true traveller;</td></tr><tr><td>    you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the</td></tr><tr><td>    commission of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are</td></tr><tr><td>    not worth another word, else I'd call you knave. I leave you.</td></tr><tr><td> Exit</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                           Enter BERTRAM</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Good, very, good, it is so then. Good, very good; let it</td></tr><tr><td>    be conceal'd awhile.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever!</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. What's the matter, sweetheart?</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,</td></tr><tr><td>    I will not bed her.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. What, what, sweetheart?</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. O my Parolles, they have married me!</td></tr><tr><td>    I'll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits</td></tr><tr><td>    The tread of a man's foot. To th' wars!</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. There's letters from my mother; what th' import is I know</td></tr><tr><td>    not yet.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Ay, that would be known. To th' wars, my boy, to th'</td></tr><tr><td>      wars!</td></tr><tr><td>    He wears his honour in a box unseen</td></tr><tr><td>    That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,</td></tr><tr><td>    Spending his manly marrow in her arms,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which should sustain the bound and high curvet</td></tr><tr><td>    Of Mars's fiery steed. To other regions!</td></tr><tr><td>    France is a stable; we that dwell in't jades;</td></tr><tr><td>    Therefore, to th' war!</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. It shall be so; I'll send her to my house,</td></tr><tr><td>    Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,</td></tr><tr><td>    And wherefore I am fled; write to the King</td></tr><tr><td>    That which I durst not speak. His present gift</td></tr><tr><td>    Shall furnish me to those Italian fields</td></tr><tr><td>    Where noble fellows strike. War is no strife</td></tr><tr><td>    To the dark house and the detested wife.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Will this capriccio hold in thee, art sure?</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Go with me to my chamber and advise me.</td></tr><tr><td>    I'll send her straight away. To-morrow</td></tr><tr><td>    I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard:</td></tr><tr><td>    A young man married is a man that's marr'd.</td></tr><tr><td>    Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go.</td></tr><tr><td>    The King has done you wrong; but, hush, 'tis so.      Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>ACT II. SCENE 4.</td></tr><tr><td>Paris. The KING'S palace</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Enter HELENA and CLOWN</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. My mother greets me kindly; is she well?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. She is not well, but yet she has her health; she's very</td></tr><tr><td>    merry, but yet she is not well. But thanks be given, she's very</td></tr><tr><td>    well, and wants nothing i' th' world; but yet she is not well.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. If she be very well, what does she ail that she's not very</td></tr><tr><td>    well?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. What two things?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her quickly!</td></tr><tr><td>    The other, that she's in earth, from whence God send her quickly!</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                        Enter PAROLLES</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Bless you, my fortunate lady!</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own good</td></tr><tr><td>    fortunes.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them on,</td></tr><tr><td>    have them still. O, my knave, how does my old lady?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. So that you had her wrinkles and I her money, I would she</td></tr><tr><td>    did as you say.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Why, I say nothing.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's tongue shakes</td></tr><tr><td>    out his master's undoing. To say nothing, to do nothing, to know</td></tr><tr><td>    nothing, and to have nothing, is to be a great part of your</td></tr><tr><td>    title, which is within a very little of nothing.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Away! th'art a knave.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. You should have said, sir, 'Before a knave th'art a knave';</td></tr><tr><td>    that's 'Before me th'art a knave.' This had been truth, sir.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. Did you find me in yourself, sir, or were you taught to find</td></tr><tr><td>    me? The search, sir, was profitable; and much fool may you find</td></tr><tr><td>    in you, even to the world's pleasure and the increase of</td></tr><tr><td>    laughter.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.</td></tr><tr><td>    Madam, my lord will go away to-night:</td></tr><tr><td>    A very serious business calls on him.</td></tr><tr><td>    The great prerogative and rite of love,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;</td></tr><tr><td>    But puts it off to a compell'd restraint;</td></tr><tr><td>    Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which they distil now in the curbed time,</td></tr><tr><td>    To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy</td></tr><tr><td>    And pleasure drown the brim.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. What's his else?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. That you will take your instant leave o' th' King,</td></tr><tr><td>    And make this haste as your own good proceeding,</td></tr><tr><td>    Strength'ned with what apology you think</td></tr><tr><td>    May make it probable need.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. What more commands he?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. That, having this obtain'd, you presently</td></tr><tr><td>    Attend his further pleasure.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. In everything I wait upon his will.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. I shall report it so.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. I pray you.                              Exit PAROLLES</td></tr><tr><td>    Come, sirrah.                                         Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>ACT II. SCENE 5.</td></tr><tr><td>Paris. The KING'S palace</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Enter LAFEU and BERTRAM</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. You have it from his own deliverance.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. And by other warranted testimony.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Then my dial goes not true; I took this lark for a bunting.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in knowledge,</td></tr><tr><td>    and accordingly valiant.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. I have then sinn'd against his experience and transgress'd</td></tr><tr><td>    against his valour; and my state that way is dangerous, since I</td></tr><tr><td>    cannot yet find in my heart to repent. Here he comes; I pray you</td></tr><tr><td>    make us friends; I will pursue the amity</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                         Enter PAROLLES</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES.  [To BERTRAM]  These things shall be done, sir.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Pray you, sir, who's his tailor?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Sir!</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. O, I know him well. Ay, sir; he, sir, 's a good workman, a</td></tr><tr><td>    very good tailor.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM.  [Aside to PAROLLES]  Is she gone to the King?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. She is.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Will she away to-night?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. As you'll have her.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,</td></tr><tr><td>    Given order for our horses; and to-night,</td></tr><tr><td>    When I should take possession of the bride,</td></tr><tr><td>    End ere I do begin.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. A good traveller is something at the latter end of a dinner;</td></tr><tr><td>    but one that lies three-thirds and uses a known truth to pass a</td></tr><tr><td>    thousand nothings with, should be once heard and thrice beaten.</td></tr><tr><td>    God save you, Captain.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's</td></tr><tr><td>    displeasure.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. You have made shift to run into 't, boots and spurs and all,</td></tr><tr><td>    like him that leapt into the custard; and out of it you'll run</td></tr><tr><td>    again, rather than suffer question for your residence.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. And shall do so ever, though I took him at's prayers.</td></tr><tr><td>    Fare you well, my lord; and believe this of me: there can be no</td></tr><tr><td>    kernal in this light nut; the soul of this man is his clothes;</td></tr><tr><td>    trust him not in matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them</td></tr><tr><td>    tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur; I have spoken</td></tr><tr><td>    better of you than you have or will to deserve at my hand; but we</td></tr><tr><td>    must do good against evil.                              Exit</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. An idle lord, I swear.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. I think so.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Why, do you not know him?</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Yes, I do know him well; and common speech</td></tr><tr><td>    Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                          Enter HELENA</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,</td></tr><tr><td>    Spoke with the King, and have procur'd his leave</td></tr><tr><td>    For present parting; only he desires</td></tr><tr><td>    Some private speech with you.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. I shall obey his will.</td></tr><tr><td>    You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which holds not colour with the time, nor does</td></tr><tr><td>    The ministration and required office</td></tr><tr><td>    On my particular. Prepar'd I was not</td></tr><tr><td>    For such a business; therefore am I found</td></tr><tr><td>    So much unsettled. This drives me to entreat you</td></tr><tr><td>    That presently you take your way for home,</td></tr><tr><td>    And rather muse than ask why I entreat you;</td></tr><tr><td>    For my respects are better than they seem,</td></tr><tr><td>    And my appointments have in them a need</td></tr><tr><td>    Greater than shows itself at the first view</td></tr><tr><td>    To you that know them not.

Sir, I can nothing say</td></tr><tr><td>    But that I am your most obedient servant.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Come, come, no more of that.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. And ever shall</td></tr><tr><td>    With true observance seek to eke out that</td></tr><tr><td>    Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd</td></tr><tr><td>    To equal my great fortune.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Let that go.</td></tr><tr><td>    My haste is very great. Farewell; hie home.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Pray, sir, your pardon.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Well, what would you say?</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,</td></tr><tr><td>    Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;</td></tr><tr><td>    But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal</td></tr><tr><td>    What law does vouch mine own.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. What would you have?</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Something; and scarce so much; nothing, indeed.</td></tr><tr><td>    I would not tell you what I would, my lord.</td></tr><tr><td>    Faith, yes:</td></tr><tr><td>    Strangers and foes do sunder and not kiss.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM.

So that, from point to point, now have you hear</td></tr><tr><td>    The fundamental reasons of this war;</td></tr><tr><td>    Whose great decision hath much blood let forth</td></tr><tr><td>    And more thirsts after.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. Holy seems the quarrel</td></tr><tr><td>    Upon your Grace's part; black and fearful</td></tr><tr><td>    On the opposer.</td></tr><tr><td>  DUKE. Therefore we marvel much our cousin France</td></tr><tr><td>    Would in so just a business shut his bosom</td></tr><tr><td>    Against our borrowing prayers.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. Good my lord,</td></tr><tr><td>    The reasons of our state I cannot yield,</td></tr><tr><td>    But like a common and an outward man</td></tr><tr><td>    That the great figure of a council frames</td></tr><tr><td>    By self-unable motion; therefore dare not</td></tr><tr><td>    Say what I think of it, since I have found</td></tr><tr><td>    Myself in my incertain grounds to fail</td></tr><tr><td>    As often as I guess'd.</td></tr><tr><td>  DUKE. Be it his pleasure.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. But I am sure the younger of our nature,</td></tr><tr><td>    That surfeit on their ease, will day by day</td></tr><tr><td>    Come here for physic.</td></tr><tr><td>  DUKE. Welcome shall they be</td></tr><tr><td>    And all the honours that can fly from us</td></tr><tr><td>    Shall on them settle.

It hath happen'd all as I would have had it, save that he</td></tr><tr><td>    comes not along with her.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very melancholy</td></tr><tr><td>    man.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. By what observance, I pray you?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the ruff and</td></tr><tr><td>    sing; ask questions and sing; pick his teeth and sing. I know a</td></tr><tr><td>    man that had this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a</td></tr><tr><td>    song.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.</td></tr><tr><td>                                              [Opening a letter]</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court. Our old ling</td></tr><tr><td>    and our Isbels o' th' country are nothing like your old ling and</td></tr><tr><td>    your Isbels o' th' court. The brains of my Cupid's knock'd out;</td></tr><tr><td>    and I begin to love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. What have we here?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. E'en that you have there.                          Exit</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS.  [Reads]  'I have sent you a daughter-in-law; she hath</td></tr><tr><td>    recovered the King and undone me. I have wedded her, not bedded</td></tr><tr><td>    her; and sworn to make the \"not\" eternal. You shall hear I am run</td></tr><tr><td>    away; know it before the report come.

O madam, yonder is heavy news within between two soldiers</td></tr><tr><td>    and my young lady.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. What is the -matter?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some comfort; your</td></tr><tr><td>    son will not be kill'd so soon as I thought he would.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Why should he be kill'd?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does the</td></tr><tr><td>    danger is in standing to 't; that's the loss of men, though it be</td></tr><tr><td>    the getting of children. Here they come will tell you more. For my</td></tr><tr><td>    part, I only hear your son was run away.                Exit</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>              Enter HELENA and the two FRENCH GENTLEMEN</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Save you, good madam.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Do not say so.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen-</td></tr><tr><td>    I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief</td></tr><tr><td>    That the first face of neither, on the start,</td></tr><tr><td>    Can woman me unto 't. Where is my son, I pray you?</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Madam, he's gone to serve the Duke of Florence.</td></tr><tr><td>    We met him thitherward; for thence we came,</td></tr><tr><td>    And, after some dispatch in hand at court,</td></tr><tr><td>    Thither we bend again.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Look on this letter, madam; here's my passport.</td></tr><tr><td>    [Reads]  'When thou canst get the ring upon my finger, which</td></tr><tr><td>    never shall come off, and show me a child begotten of thy body</td></tr><tr><td>    that I am father to, then call me husband; but in such a \"then\" I</td></tr><tr><td>    write a \"never.\"</td></tr><tr><td>    This is a dreadful sentence.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Brought you this letter, gentlemen?</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam;</td></tr><tr><td>    And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pains.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;</td></tr><tr><td>    If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou robb'st me of a moiety. He was my son;</td></tr><tr><td>    But I do wash his name out of my blood,</td></tr><tr><td>    And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. And to be a soldier?</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Such is his noble purpose; and, believe 't,</td></tr><tr><td>    The Duke will lay upon him all the honour</td></tr><tr><td>    That good convenience claims.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Return you thither?</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA.  [Reads]  'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'</td></tr><tr><td>    'Tis bitter.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Find you that there?</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Ay, madam.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. 'Tis but the boldness of his hand haply, which</td></tr><tr><td>    his heart was not consenting to.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Nothing in France until he have no wife!</td></tr><tr><td>    There's nothing here that is too good for him</td></tr><tr><td>    But only she; and she deserves a lord</td></tr><tr><td>    That twenty such rude boys might tend upon,</td></tr><tr><td>    And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. A servant only, and a gentleman</td></tr><tr><td>    Which I have sometime known.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Parolles, was it not?</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Ay, my good lady, he.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.</td></tr><tr><td>    My son corrupts a well-derived nature</td></tr><tr><td>    With his inducement.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Indeed, good lady,</td></tr><tr><td>    The fellow has a deal of that too much</td></tr><tr><td>    Which holds him much to have.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Y'are welcome, gentlemen.</td></tr><tr><td>    I will entreat you, when you see my son,</td></tr><tr><td>    To tell him that his sword can never win</td></tr><tr><td>    The honour that he loses. More I'll entreat you</td></tr><tr><td>    Written to bear along.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST GENTLEMAN. We serve you, madam,</td></tr><tr><td>    In that and all your worthiest affairs.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Not so, but as we change our courtesies.</td></tr><tr><td>    Will you draw near?            Exeunt COUNTESS and GENTLEMEN</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. 'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'</td></tr><tr><td>    Nothing in France until he has no wife!</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France</td></tr><tr><td>    Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't</td></tr><tr><td>    That chase thee from thy country, and expose</td></tr><tr><td>    Those tender limbs of thine to the event</td></tr><tr><td>    Of the non-sparing war? And is it I</td></tr><tr><td>    That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou</td></tr><tr><td>    Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark</td></tr><tr><td>    Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,</td></tr><tr><td>    That ride upon the violent speed of fire,</td></tr><tr><td>    Fly with false aim; move the still-piecing air,</td></tr><tr><td>    That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.</td></tr><tr><td>    Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;</td></tr><tr><td>    Whoever charges on his forward breast,</td></tr><tr><td>    I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;</td></tr><tr><td>    And though I kill him not, I am the cause</td></tr><tr><td>    His death was so effected. Better 'twere</td></tr><tr><td>    I met the ravin lion when he roar'd</td></tr><tr><td>    With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere</td></tr><tr><td>    That all the miseries which nature owes</td></tr><tr><td>    Were mine at once. No; come thou home, Rousillon,</td></tr><tr><td>    Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,</td></tr><tr><td>    As oft it loses all. I will be gone.</td></tr><tr><td>    My being here it is that holds thee hence.</td></tr><tr><td>    Shall I stay here to do 't? No, no, although</td></tr><tr><td>    The air of paradise did fan the house,</td></tr><tr><td>    And angels offic'd all. I will be gone,</td></tr><tr><td>    That pitiful rumour may report my flight</td></tr><tr><td>    To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day.</td></tr><tr><td>    For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.         Exit</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>ACT III. SCENE 3.</td></tr><tr><td>Florence. Before the DUKE's palace</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Flourish. Enter the DUKE OF FLORENCE, BERTRAM, PAROLLES, SOLDIERS,</td></tr><tr><td>drum and trumpets</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  DUKE. The General of our Horse thou art; and we,</td></tr><tr><td>    Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence</td></tr><tr><td>    Upon thy promising fortune.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Sir, it is</td></tr><tr><td>    A charge too heavy for my strength; but yet</td></tr><tr><td>    We'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake</td></tr><tr><td>    To th' extreme edge of hazard.</td></tr><tr><td>  DUKE. Then go thou forth;</td></tr><tr><td>    And Fortune play upon thy prosperous helm,</td></tr><tr><td>    As thy auspicious mistress!</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. This very day,</td></tr><tr><td>    Great Mars, I put myself into thy file;</td></tr><tr><td>    Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove</td></tr><tr><td>    A lover of thy drum, hater of love.                   Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>ACT III. SCENE 4.</td></tr><tr><td>Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Enter COUNTESS and STEWARD</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Alas! and would you take the letter of her?</td></tr><tr><td>    Might you not know she would do as she has done</td></tr><tr><td>    By sending me a letter? Read it again.</td></tr><tr><td>  STEWARD.  [Reads]  'I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone.</td></tr><tr><td>    Ambitious love hath so in me offended</td></tr><tr><td>    That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,</td></tr><tr><td>    With sainted vow my faults to have amended.</td></tr><tr><td>    Write, write, that from the bloody course of war</td></tr><tr><td>    My dearest master, your dear son, may hie.</td></tr><tr><td>    Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far</td></tr><tr><td>    His name with zealous fervour sanctify.</td></tr><tr><td>    His taken labours bid him me forgive;</td></tr><tr><td>    I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth</td></tr><tr><td>    From courtly friends, with camping foes to live,</td></tr><tr><td>    Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth.</td></tr><tr><td>    He is too good and fair for death and me;</td></tr><tr><td>    Whom I myself embrace to set him free.'</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!</td></tr><tr><td>    Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much</td></tr><tr><td>    As letting her pass so; had I spoke with her,</td></tr><tr><td>    I could have well diverted her intents,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which thus she hath prevented.</td></tr><tr><td>  STEWARD. Pardon me, madam;</td></tr><tr><td>    If I had given you this at over-night,</td></tr><tr><td>    She might have been o'er ta'en; and yet she writes</td></tr><tr><td>    Pursuit would be but vain.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. What angel shall</td></tr><tr><td>    Bless this unworthy husband? He cannot thrive,</td></tr><tr><td>    Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear</td></tr><tr><td>    And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath</td></tr><tr><td>    Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,</td></tr><tr><td>    To this unworthy husband of his wife;</td></tr><tr><td>    Let every word weigh heavy of her worth</td></tr><tr><td>    That he does weigh too light. My greatest grief,</td></tr><tr><td>    Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.</td></tr><tr><td>    Dispatch the most convenient messenger.</td></tr><tr><td>    When haply he shall hear that she is gone</td></tr><tr><td>    He will return; and hope I may that she,</td></tr><tr><td>    Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,</td></tr><tr><td>    Led hither by pure love. Which of them both</td></tr><tr><td>    Is dearest to me I have no skill in sense</td></tr><tr><td>    To make distinction. Provide this messenger.</td></tr><tr><td>    My heart is heavy, and mine age is weak;</td></tr><tr><td>    Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.     Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>ACT III. SCENE 5.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Without the walls of Florence</td></tr><tr><td>A tucket afar off. Enter an old WIDOW OF FLORENCE, her daughter DIANA,</td></tr><tr><td>VIOLENTA, and MARIANA, with other CITIZENS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  WIDOW. Nay, come; for if they do approach the city we shall lose</td></tr><tr><td>    all the sight.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. They say the French count has done most honourable service.</td></tr><tr><td>  WIDOW. It is reported that he has taken their great'st commander;</td></tr><tr><td>    and that with his own hand he slew the Duke's brother.  [Tucket]</td></tr><tr><td>    We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary way. Hark! you</td></tr><tr><td>    may know by their trumpets.</td></tr><tr><td>  MARIANA. Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with the</td></tr><tr><td>    report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this French earl; the</td></tr><tr><td>    honour of a maid is her name, and no legacy is so rich as</td></tr><tr><td>    honesty.</td></tr><tr><td>  WIDOW. I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a</td></tr><tr><td>    gentleman his companion.</td></tr><tr><td>  MARIANA. I know that knave, hang him! one Parolles; a filthy</td></tr><tr><td>    officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl. Beware of</td></tr><tr><td>    them, Diana: their promises, enticements, oaths, tokens, and all</td></tr><tr><td>    these engines of lust, are not the things they go under; many a</td></tr><tr><td>    maid hath been seduced by them; and the misery is, example, that</td></tr><tr><td>    so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood, cannot for all that</td></tr><tr><td>    dissuade succession, but that they are limed with the twigs that</td></tr><tr><td>    threatens them. I hope I need not to advise you further; but I</td></tr><tr><td>    hope your own grace will keep you where you are, though there</td></tr><tr><td>    were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. You shall not need to fear me.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>            Enter HELENA in the dress of a pilgrim</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  WIDOW. I hope so. Look, here comes a pilgrim. I know she will lie</td></tr><tr><td>    at my house: thither they send one another. I'll question her.</td></tr><tr><td>    God save you, pilgrim! Whither are bound?</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. To Saint Jaques le Grand.</td></tr><tr><td>    Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?</td></tr><tr><td>  WIDOW. At the Saint Francis here, beside the port.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Is this the way?</td></tr><tr><td>                                                  [A march afar]</td></tr><tr><td>  WIDOW. Ay, marry, is't. Hark you! They come this way.</td></tr><tr><td>    If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,</td></tr><tr><td>    But till the troops come by,</td></tr><tr><td>    I will conduct you where you shall be lodg'd;</td></tr><tr><td>    The rather for I think I know your hostess</td></tr><tr><td>    As ample as myself.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Is it yourself?</td></tr><tr><td>  WIDOW. If you shall please so, pilgrim.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.</td></tr><tr><td>  WIDOW. You came, I think, from France?</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. I did so.</td></tr><tr><td>  WIDOW. Here you shall see a countryman of yours</td></tr><tr><td>    That has done worthy service.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. His name, I pray you.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. The Count Rousillon. Know you such a one?</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him;</td></tr><tr><td>    His face I know not.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. What some'er he is,</td></tr><tr><td>    He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,</td></tr><tr><td>    As 'tis reported, for the King had married him</td></tr><tr><td>    Against his liking. Think you it is so?</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Ay, surely, mere the truth; I know his lady.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. There is a gentleman that serves the Count</td></tr><tr><td>    Reports but coarsely of her.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. What's his name?</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. Monsieur Parolles.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. O, I believe with him,</td></tr><tr><td>    In argument of praise, or to the worth</td></tr><tr><td>    Of the great Count himself, she is too mean</td></tr><tr><td>    To have her name repeated; all her deserving</td></tr><tr><td>    Is a reserved honesty, and that</td></tr><tr><td>    I have not heard examin'd.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. Alas, poor lady!</td></tr><tr><td>    'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife</td></tr><tr><td>    Of a detesting lord.</td></tr><tr><td>  WIDOW. I sweet, good creature, wheresoe'er she is</td></tr><tr><td>    Her heart weighs sadly. This young maid might do her</td></tr><tr><td>    A shrewd turn, if she pleas'd.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. How do you mean?</td></tr><tr><td>    May be the amorous Count solicits her</td></tr><tr><td>    In the unlawful purpose.</td></tr><tr><td>  WIDOW. He does, indeed;</td></tr><tr><td>    And brokes with all that can in such a suit</td></tr><tr><td>    Corrupt the tender honour of a maid;</td></tr><tr><td>    But she is arm'd for him, and keeps her guard</td></tr><tr><td>    In honestest defence.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>    Enter, with drum and colours, BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and the</td></tr><tr><td>                          whole ARMY</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  MARIANA. The gods forbid else!</td></tr><tr><td>  WIDOW. So, now they come.</td></tr><tr><td>    That is Antonio, the Duke's eldest son;</td></tr><tr><td>    That, Escalus.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Which is the Frenchman?</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. He-</td></tr><tr><td>    That with the plume; 'tis a most gallant fellow.</td></tr><tr><td>    I would he lov'd his wife; if he were honester</td></tr><tr><td>    He were much goodlier. Is't not a handsome gentleman?</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. I like him well.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. 'Tis pity he is not honest. Yond's that same knave</td></tr><tr><td>    That leads him to these places; were I his lady</td></tr><tr><td>    I would poison that vile rascal.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Which is he?</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. That jack-an-apes with scarfs. Why is he melancholy?</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Perchance he's hurt i' th' battle.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Lose our drum! well.</td></tr><tr><td>  MARIANA. He's shrewdly vex'd at something.</td></tr><tr><td>    Look, he has spied us.</td></tr><tr><td>  WIDOW. Marry, hang you!</td></tr><tr><td>  MARIANA. And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!</td></tr><tr><td>                              Exeunt BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and ARMY</td></tr><tr><td>  WIDOW. The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you</td></tr><tr><td>    Where you shall host. Of enjoin'd penitents</td></tr><tr><td>    There's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,</td></tr><tr><td>    Already at my house.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. I humbly thank you.</td></tr><tr><td>    Please it this matron and this gentle maid</td></tr><tr><td>    To eat with us to-night; the charge and thanking</td></tr><tr><td>    Shall be for me, and, to requite you further,</td></tr><tr><td>    I will bestow some precepts of this virgin,</td></tr><tr><td>    Worthy the note.</td></tr><tr><td>    BOTH. We'll take your offer kindly.                   Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>ACT III. SCENE 6.</td></tr><tr><td>Camp before Florence</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Enter BERTRAM, and the two FRENCH LORDS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his way.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. If your lordship find him not a hiding, hold me no more</td></tr><tr><td>    in your respect.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. On my life, my lord, a bubble.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Do you think I am so far deceived in him?</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,</td></tr><tr><td>    without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman, he's a</td></tr><tr><td>    most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly</td></tr><tr><td>    promise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality worthy your</td></tr><tr><td>    lordship's entertainment.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in his</td></tr><tr><td>    virtue, which he hath not, he might at some great and trusty</td></tr><tr><td>    business in a main danger fail you.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. I would I knew in what particular action to try him.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. None better than to let him fetch off his drum, which</td></tr><tr><td>    you hear him so confidently undertake to do.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. I with a troop of Florentines will suddenly surprise</td></tr><tr><td>    him; such I will have whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy.</td></tr><tr><td>    We will bind and hoodwink him so that he shall suppose no other</td></tr><tr><td>    but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when</td></tr><tr><td>    we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship present at</td></tr><tr><td>    his examination; if he do not, for the promise of his life and in</td></tr><tr><td>    the highest compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you and</td></tr><tr><td>    deliver all the intelligence in his power against you, and that</td></tr><tr><td>    with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never trust my</td></tr><tr><td>    judgment in anything.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum; he</td></tr><tr><td>    says he has a stratagem for't. When your lordship sees the bottom</td></tr><tr><td>    of his success in't, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of</td></tr><tr><td>    ore will be melted, if you give him not John Drum's</td></tr><tr><td>    entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed. Here he comes.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                      Enter PAROLLES</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. O, for the love of laughter, hinder not the honour of</td></tr><tr><td>    his design; let him fetch off his drum in any hand.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. How now, monsieur! This drum sticks sorely in your</td></tr><tr><td>    disposition.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. A pox on 't; let it go; 'tis but a drum.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. But a drum! Is't but a drum? A drum so lost! There was</td></tr><tr><td>    excellent command: to charge in with our horse upon our own</td></tr><tr><td>    wings, and to rend our own soldiers!</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. That was not to be blam'd in the command of the</td></tr><tr><td>    service; it was a disaster of war that Caesar himself could not</td></tr><tr><td>    have prevented, if he had been there to command.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success.</td></tr><tr><td>    Some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is not to</td></tr><tr><td>    be recovered.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. It might have been recovered.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. It might, but it is not now.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. It is to be recovered. But that the merit of service is</td></tr><tr><td>    seldom attributed to the true and exact performer, I would have</td></tr><tr><td>    that drum or another, or 'hic jacet.'</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur. If you think</td></tr><tr><td>    your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour</td></tr><tr><td>    again into his native quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise,</td></tr><tr><td>    and go on; I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit. If you</td></tr><tr><td>    speed well in it, the Duke shall both speak of it and extend to</td></tr><tr><td>    you what further becomes his greatness, even to the utmost</td></tr><tr><td>    syllable of our worthiness.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. But you must not now slumber in it.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. I'll about it this evening; and I will presently pen</td></tr><tr><td>    down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my certainty, put myself</td></tr><tr><td>    into my mortal preparation; and by midnight look to hear further</td></tr><tr><td>    from me.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. May I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are gone about it?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. I know not what the success will be, my lord, but the</td></tr><tr><td>    attempt I vow.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. I know th' art valiant; and, to the of thy soldiership,</td></tr><tr><td>    will subscribe for thee. Farewell.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. I love not many words.                          Exit</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a strange</td></tr><tr><td>    fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems to undertake this</td></tr><tr><td>    business, which he knows is not to be done; damns himself to do,</td></tr><tr><td>    and dares better be damn'd than to do 't.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. You do not know him, my lord, as we do. Certain it is</td></tr><tr><td>    that he will steal himself into a man's favour, and for a week</td></tr><tr><td>    escape a great deal of discoveries; but when you find him out,</td></tr><tr><td>    you have him ever after.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of this that</td></tr><tr><td>    so seriously he does address himself unto?</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. None in the world; but return with an invention, and</td></tr><tr><td>    clap upon you two or three probable lies. But we have almost</td></tr><tr><td>    emboss'd him. You shall see his fall to-night; for indeed he is</td></tr><tr><td>    not for your lordship's respect.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him.</td></tr><tr><td>    He was first smok'd by the old Lord Lafeu. When his disguise and</td></tr><tr><td>    he is parted, tell me what a sprat you shall find him; which you</td></tr><tr><td>    shall see this very night.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. I must go look my twigs; he shall be caught.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Your brother, he shall go along with me.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. As't please your lordship. I'll leave you.   Exit</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Now will I lead you to the house, and show you</td></tr><tr><td>    The lass I spoke of.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. But you say she's honest.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. That's all the fault. I spoke with her but once,</td></tr><tr><td>    And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,</td></tr><tr><td>    By this same coxcomb that we have i' th' wind,</td></tr><tr><td>    Tokens and letters which she did re-send;</td></tr><tr><td>    And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature;</td></tr><tr><td>    Will you go see her?</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. With all my heart, my lord.                 Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>ACT III. SCENE 7.</td></tr><tr><td>Florence. The WIDOW'S house</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Enter HELENA and WIDOW</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. If you misdoubt me that I am not she,</td></tr><tr><td>    I know not how I shall assure you further</td></tr><tr><td>    But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.</td></tr><tr><td>  WIDOW. Though my estate be fall'n, I was well born,</td></tr><tr><td>    Nothing acquainted with these businesses;</td></tr><tr><td>    And would not put my reputation now</td></tr><tr><td>    In any staining act.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Nor would I wish you.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST give me trust the Count he is my husband,</td></tr><tr><td>    And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken</td></tr><tr><td>    Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,</td></tr><tr><td>    By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,</td></tr><tr><td>    Err in bestowing it.</td></tr><tr><td>  WIDOW. I should believe you;</td></tr><tr><td>    For you have show'd me that which well approves</td></tr><tr><td>    Y'are great in fortune.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Take this purse of gold,</td></tr><tr><td>    And let me buy your friendly help thus far,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which I will over-pay and pay again</td></tr><tr><td>    When I have found it. The Count he woos your daughter</td></tr><tr><td>    Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,</td></tr><tr><td>    Resolv'd to carry her. Let her in fine consent,</td></tr><tr><td>    As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.</td></tr><tr><td>    Now his important blood will nought deny</td></tr><tr><td>    That she'll demand. A ring the County wears</td></tr><tr><td>    That downward hath succeeded in his house</td></tr><tr><td>    From son to son some four or five descents</td></tr><tr><td>    Since the first father wore it. This ring he holds</td></tr><tr><td>    In most rich choice; yet, in his idle fire,</td></tr><tr><td>    To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,</td></tr><tr><td>    Howe'er repented after.</td></tr><tr><td>  WIDOW. Now I see</td></tr><tr><td>    The bottom of your purpose.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. You see it lawful then. It is no more</td></tr><tr><td>    But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,</td></tr><tr><td>    Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;</td></tr><tr><td>    In fine, delivers me to fill the time,</td></tr><tr><td>    Herself most chastely absent. After this,</td></tr><tr><td>    To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns</td></tr><tr><td>    To what is pass'd already.</td></tr><tr><td>  WIDOW. I have yielded.</td></tr><tr><td>    Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,</td></tr><tr><td>    That time and place with this deceit so lawful</td></tr><tr><td>    May prove coherent. Every night he comes</td></tr><tr><td>    With musics of all sorts, and songs compos'd</td></tr><tr><td>    To her unworthiness. It nothing steads us</td></tr><tr><td>    To chide him from our eaves, for he persists</td></tr><tr><td>    As if his life lay on 't.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Why then to-night</td></tr><tr><td>    Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,</td></tr><tr><td>    Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed,</td></tr><tr><td>    And lawful meaning in a lawful act;</td></tr><tr><td>    Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact.</td></tr><tr><td>    But let's about it.

SCENE 1.</td></tr><tr><td>Without the Florentine camp</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Enter SECOND FRENCH LORD with five or six other SOLDIERS in ambush</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.</td></tr><tr><td>    When you sally upon him, speak what terrible language you will;</td></tr><tr><td>    though you understand it not yourselves, no matter; for we must</td></tr><tr><td>    not seem to understand him, unless some one among us, whom we</td></tr><tr><td>    must produce for an interpreter.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. Good captain, let me be th' interpreter.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. Art not acquainted with him? Knows he not thy voice?</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. No, sir, I warrant you.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. But what linsey-woolsey has thou to speak to us again?</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. E'en such as you speak to me.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. He must think us some band of strangers i' th'</td></tr><tr><td>    adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of all</td></tr><tr><td>    neighbouring languages, therefore we must every one be a man of</td></tr><tr><td>    his own fancy; not to know what we speak one to another, so we</td></tr><tr><td>    seem to know, is to know straight our purpose: choughs' language,</td></tr><tr><td>    gabble enough, and good enough. As for you, interpreter, you must</td></tr><tr><td>    seem very politic. But couch, ho! here he comes; to beguile two</td></tr><tr><td>    hours in a sleep, and then to return and swear the lies he forges.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                         Enter PAROLLES</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Ten o'clock. Within these three hours 'twill be time</td></tr><tr><td>    enough to go home. What shall I say I have done? It must be a</td></tr><tr><td>    very plausive invention that carries it. They begin to smoke me;</td></tr><tr><td>    and disgraces have of late knock'd to often at my door. I find my</td></tr><tr><td>    tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the fear of Mars</td></tr><tr><td>    before it, and of his creatures, not daring the reports of my</td></tr><tr><td>    tongue.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue was</td></tr><tr><td>    guilty of.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. What the devil should move me to undertake the recovery</td></tr><tr><td>    of this drum, being not ignorant of the impossibility, and</td></tr><tr><td>    knowing I had no such purpose? I must give myself some hurts, and</td></tr><tr><td>    say I got them in exploit. Yet slight ones will not carry it.</td></tr><tr><td>    They will say 'Came you off with so little?' And great ones I</td></tr><tr><td>    dare not give. Wherefore, what's the instance? Tongue, I must put</td></tr><tr><td>    you into a butterwoman's mouth, and buy myself another of</td></tr><tr><td>    Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. Is it possible he should know what he is, and be that</td></tr><tr><td>    he is?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. I would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn,</td></tr><tr><td>    or the breaking of my Spanish sword.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. We cannot afford you so.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in</td></tr><tr><td>    stratagem.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. 'Twould not do.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripp'd.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. Hardly serve.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Though I swore I leap'd from the window of the citadel-</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. How deep?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Thirty fathom.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. I would I had any drum of the enemy's; I would swear I</td></tr><tr><td>    recover'd it.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. You shall hear one anon.          [Alarum within]</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. A drum now of the enemy's!</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.</td></tr><tr><td>  ALL. Cargo, cargo, cargo, villianda par corbo, cargo.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. O, ransom, ransom! Do not hide mine eyes.</td></tr><tr><td>                                            [They blindfold him]</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. Boskos thromuldo boskos.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. I know you are the Muskos' regiment,</td></tr><tr><td>    And I shall lose my life for want of language.</td></tr><tr><td>    If there be here German, or Dane, Low Dutch,</td></tr><tr><td>    Italian, or French, let him speak to me;</td></tr><tr><td>    I'll discover that which shall undo the Florentine.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. Boskos vauvado. I understand thee, and can speak thy</td></tr><tr><td>    tongue. Kerely-bonto, sir, betake thee to thy faith, for</td></tr><tr><td>    seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. O!</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. O, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. Oscorbidulchos volivorco.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. The General is content to spare thee yet;</td></tr><tr><td>    And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on</td></tr><tr><td>    To gather from thee. Haply thou mayst inform</td></tr><tr><td>    Something to save thy life.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. O, let me live,</td></tr><tr><td>    And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,</td></tr><tr><td>    Their force, their purposes. Nay, I'll speak that</td></tr><tr><td>    Which you will wonder at.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. But wilt thou faithfully?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. If I do not, damn me.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. Acordo linta.</td></tr><tr><td>    Come on; thou art granted space.</td></tr><tr><td>                   Exit, PAROLLES guarded. A short alarum within</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. Go, tell the Count Rousillon and my brother</td></tr><tr><td>    We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled</td></tr><tr><td>    Till we do hear from them.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND SOLDIER. Captain, I will.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. 'A will betray us all unto ourselves-</td></tr><tr><td>    Inform on that.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND SOLDIER. So I will, sir.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. Till then I'll keep him dark and safely lock'd.</td></tr><tr><td>                                                          Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>ACT IV. SCENE 2.</td></tr><tr><td>Florence. The WIDOW'S house</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Enter BERTRAM and DIANA</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. They told me that your name was Fontibell.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. No, my good lord, Diana.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Titled goddess;</td></tr><tr><td>    And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,</td></tr><tr><td>    In your fine frame hath love no quality?</td></tr><tr><td>    If the quick fire of youth light not your mind,</td></tr><tr><td>    You are no maiden, but a monument;</td></tr><tr><td>    When you are dead, you should be such a one</td></tr><tr><td>    As you are now, for you are cold and stern;</td></tr><tr><td>    And now you should be as your mother was</td></tr><tr><td>    When your sweet self was got.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. She then was honest.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. So should you be.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. No.</td></tr><tr><td>    My mother did but duty; such, my lord,</td></tr><tr><td>    As you owe to your wife.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. No more o'that!</td></tr><tr><td>    I prithee do not strive against my vows.</td></tr><tr><td>    I was compell'd to her; but I love the</td></tr><tr><td>    By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever</td></tr><tr><td>    Do thee all rights of service.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. Ay, so you serve us</td></tr><tr><td>    Till we serve you; but when you have our roses</td></tr><tr><td>    You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves,</td></tr><tr><td>    And mock us with our bareness.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. How have I sworn!</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. 'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,</td></tr><tr><td>    But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.</td></tr><tr><td>    What is not holy, that we swear not by,</td></tr><tr><td>    But take the High'st to witness. Then, pray you, tell me:</td></tr><tr><td>    If I should swear by Jove's great attributes</td></tr><tr><td>    I lov'd you dearly, would you believe my oaths</td></tr><tr><td>    When I did love you ill? This has no holding,</td></tr><tr><td>    To swear by him whom I protest to love</td></tr><tr><td>    That I will work against him. Therefore your oaths</td></tr><tr><td>    Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd-</td></tr><tr><td>    At least in my opinion.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Change it, change it;</td></tr><tr><td>    Be not so holy-cruel. Love is holy;</td></tr><tr><td>    And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts</td></tr><tr><td>    That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,</td></tr><tr><td>    But give thyself unto my sick desires,</td></tr><tr><td>    Who then recovers. Say thou art mine, and ever</td></tr><tr><td>    My love as it begins shall so persever.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. I see that men make ropes in such a scarre</td></tr><tr><td>    That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. I'll lend it thee, my dear, but have no power</td></tr><tr><td>    To give it from me.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. Will you not, my lord?</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. It is an honour 'longing to our house,</td></tr><tr><td>    Bequeathed down from many ancestors;</td></tr><tr><td>    Which were the greatest obloquy i' th' world</td></tr><tr><td>    In me to lose.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. Mine honour's such a ring:</td></tr><tr><td>    My chastity's the jewel of our house,</td></tr><tr><td>    Bequeathed down from many ancestors;</td></tr><tr><td>    Which were the greatest obloquy i' th' world</td></tr><tr><td>    In me to lose. Thus your own proper wisdom</td></tr><tr><td>    Brings in the champion Honour on my part</td></tr><tr><td>    Against your vain assault.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Here, take my ring;</td></tr><tr><td>    My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,</td></tr><tr><td>    And I'll be bid by thee.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. When midnight comes, knock at my chamber window;</td></tr><tr><td>    I'll order take my mother shall not hear.</td></tr><tr><td>    Now will I charge you in the band of truth,</td></tr><tr><td>    When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,</td></tr><tr><td>    Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:</td></tr><tr><td>    My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them</td></tr><tr><td>    When back again this ring shall be deliver'd.</td></tr><tr><td>    And on your finger in the night I'll put</td></tr><tr><td>    Another ring, that what in time proceeds</td></tr><tr><td>    May token to the future our past deeds.</td></tr><tr><td>    Adieu till then; then fail not. You have won</td></tr><tr><td>    A wife of me, though there my hope be done.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.</td></tr><tr><td> Exit</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. For which live long to thank both heaven and me!</td></tr><tr><td>    You may so in the end.</td></tr><tr><td>    My mother told me just how he would woo,</td></tr><tr><td>    As if she sat in's heart; she says all men</td></tr><tr><td>    Have the like oaths. He had sworn to marry me</td></tr><tr><td>    When his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with him</td></tr><tr><td>    When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,</td></tr><tr><td>    Marry that will, I live and die a maid.</td></tr><tr><td>    Only, in this disguise, I think't no sin</td></tr><tr><td>    To cozen him that would unjustly win.                   Exit</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>ACT IV. SCENE 3.</td></tr><tr><td>The Florentine camp</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Enter the two FRENCH LORDS, and two or three SOLDIERS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. You have not given him his mother's letter?</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. I have deliv'red it an hour since. There is something</td></tr><tr><td>    in't that stings his nature; for on the reading it he chang'd</td></tr><tr><td>    almost into another man.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off</td></tr><tr><td>    so good a wife and so sweet a lady.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. Especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure</td></tr><tr><td>    of the King, who had even tun'd his bounty to sing happiness to</td></tr><tr><td>    him. I will tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly</td></tr><tr><td>    with you.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the grave</td></tr><tr><td>    of it.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence,</td></tr><tr><td>    of a most chaste renown; and this night he fleshes his will in</td></tr><tr><td>    the spoil of her honour. He hath given her his monumental ring,</td></tr><tr><td>    and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. Now, God delay our rebellion! As we are ourselves,</td></tr><tr><td>    what things are we!</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course of</td></tr><tr><td>    all treasons we still see them reveal themselves till they attain</td></tr><tr><td>    to their abhorr'd ends; so he that in this action contrives</td></tr><tr><td>    against his own nobility, in his proper stream, o'erflows</td></tr><tr><td>    himself.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. Is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of our</td></tr><tr><td>    unlawful intents? We shall not then have his company to-night?</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. That approaches apace. I would gladly have him see his</td></tr><tr><td>    company anatomiz'd, that he might take a measure of his own</td></tr><tr><td>    judgments, wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. We will not meddle with him till he come; for his</td></tr><tr><td>    presence must be the whip of the other.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. In the meantime, what hear you of these wars?</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. I hear there is an overture of peace.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. What will Count Rousillon do then? Will he travel</td></tr><tr><td>    higher, or return again into France?</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether</td></tr><tr><td>    of his counsel.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. Let it be forbid, sir! So should I be a great deal</td></tr><tr><td>    of his act.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. Sir, his wife, some two months since, fled from his</td></tr><tr><td>    house. Her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand;</td></tr><tr><td>    which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she</td></tr><tr><td>    accomplish'd; and, there residing, the tenderness of her nature</td></tr><tr><td>    became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan of her last</td></tr><tr><td>    breath, and now she sings in heaven.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. How is this justified?</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. The stronger part of it by her own letters, which</td></tr><tr><td>    makes her story true even to the point of her death. Her death</td></tr><tr><td>    itself, which could not be her office to say is come, was</td></tr><tr><td>    faithfully confirm'd by the rector of the place.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. Hath the Count all this intelligence?</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from</td></tr><tr><td>    point, to the full arming of the verity.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our</td></tr><tr><td>    losses!</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in</td></tr><tr><td>    tears! The great dignity that his valour hath here acquir'd for</td></tr><tr><td>    him shall at home be encount'red with a shame as ample.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill</td></tr><tr><td>    together. Our virtues would be proud if our faults whipt them</td></tr><tr><td>    not; and our crimes would despair if they were not cherish'd by</td></tr><tr><td>    our virtues.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                      Enter a MESSENGER</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>    How now? Where's your master?</td></tr><tr><td>  SERVANT. He met the Duke in the street, sir; of whom he hath taken</td></tr><tr><td>    a solemn leave. His lordship will next morning for France. The</td></tr><tr><td>    Duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the King.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. They shall be no more than needful there, if they were</td></tr><tr><td>    more than they can commend.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. They cannot be too sweet for the King's tartness.</td></tr><tr><td>    Here's his lordship now.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                        Enter BERTRAM</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>    How now, my lord, is't not after midnight?</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. I have to-night dispatch'd sixteen businesses, a month's</td></tr><tr><td>    length apiece; by an abstract of success: I have congied with the</td></tr><tr><td>    Duke, done my adieu with his nearest; buried a wife, mourn'd for</td></tr><tr><td>    her; writ to my lady mother I am returning; entertain'd my</td></tr><tr><td>    convoy; and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many</td></tr><tr><td>    nicer needs. The last was the greatest, but that I have not ended</td></tr><tr><td>    yet.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. If the business be of any difficulty and this morning</td></tr><tr><td>    your departure hence, it requires haste of your lordship.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. I mean the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of it</td></tr><tr><td>    hereafter. But shall we have this dialogue between the Fool and</td></tr><tr><td>    the Soldier? Come, bring forth this counterfeit module has</td></tr><tr><td>    deceiv'd me like a double-meaning prophesier.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. Bring him forth.  [Exeunt SOLDIERS]  Has sat i' th'</td></tr><tr><td>    stocks all night, poor gallant knave.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. No matter; his heels have deserv'd it, in usurping his</td></tr><tr><td>    spurs so long. How does he carry himself?</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. I have told your lordship already the stocks carry</td></tr><tr><td>    him. But to answer you as you would be understood: he weeps like</td></tr><tr><td>    a wench that had shed her milk; he hath confess'd himself to</td></tr><tr><td>    Morgan, whom he supposes to be a friar, from the time of his</td></tr><tr><td>    remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i' th'</td></tr><tr><td>    stocks. And what think you he hath confess'd?</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Nothing of me, has 'a?</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his</td></tr><tr><td>    face; if your lordship be in't, as I believe you are, you must</td></tr><tr><td>    have the patience to hear it.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                   Enter PAROLLES guarded, and</td></tr><tr><td>                  FIRST SOLDIER as interpreter</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. A plague upon him! muffled! He can say nothing of me.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. Hush, hush! Hoodman comes. Portotartarossa.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. He calls for the tortures. What will you say without</td></tr><tr><td>    'em?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. I will confess what I know without constraint; if ye</td></tr><tr><td>    pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. Bosko chimurcho.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. Boblibindo chicurmurco.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. YOU are a merciful general. Our General bids you</td></tr><tr><td>    answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. And truly, as I hope to live.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. 'First demand of him how many horse the Duke is</td></tr><tr><td>    strong.' What say you to that?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Five or six thousand; but very weak and unserviceable.</td></tr><tr><td>    The troops are all scattered, and the commanders very poor</td></tr><tr><td>    rogues, upon my reputation and credit, and as I hope to live.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. Shall I set down your answer so?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Do; I'll take the sacrament on 't, how and which way you</td></tr><tr><td>    will.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. Y'are deceiv'd, my lord; this is Monsieur Parolles,</td></tr><tr><td>    the gallant militarist-that was his own phrase-that had the whole</td></tr><tr><td>    theoric of war in the knot of his scarf, and the practice in the</td></tr><tr><td>    chape of his dagger.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword</td></tr><tr><td>    clean; nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing his</td></tr><tr><td>    apparel neatly.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. 'Five or six thousand horse' I said-I will say true- 'or</td></tr><tr><td>    thereabouts' set down, for I'll speak truth.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. He's very near the truth in this.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. But I con him no thanks for't in the nature he delivers it.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. 'Poor rogues' I pray you say.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. I humbly thank you, sir. A truth's a truth-the rogues are</td></tr><tr><td>    marvellous poor.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. 'Demand of him of what strength they are a-foot.'</td></tr><tr><td>    What say you to that?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present hour, I</td></tr><tr><td>    will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a hundred and fifty;</td></tr><tr><td>    Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian,</td></tr><tr><td>    Cosmo, Lodowick, and Gratii, two hundred fifty each; mine own</td></tr><tr><td>    company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred fifty each; so</td></tr><tr><td>    that the muster-file, rotten and sound, upon my life, amounts not</td></tr><tr><td>    to fifteen thousand poll; half of the which dare not shake the</td></tr><tr><td>    snow from off their cassocks lest they shake themselves to</td></tr><tr><td>    pieces.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. What shall be done to him?</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my</td></tr><tr><td>    condition, and what credit I have with the Duke.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down. 'You shall demand of him</td></tr><tr><td>    whether one Captain Dumain be i' th' camp, a Frenchman; what his</td></tr><tr><td>    reputation is with the Duke, what his valour, honesty, expertness</td></tr><tr><td>    in wars; or whether he thinks it were not possible, with</td></tr><tr><td>    well-weighing sums of gold, to corrupt him to a revolt.' What say</td></tr><tr><td>    you to this? What do you know of it?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of the</td></tr><tr><td>    inter'gatories. Demand them singly.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. Do you know this Captain Dumain?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. I know him: 'a was a botcher's prentice in Paris, from</td></tr><tr><td>    whence he was whipt for getting the shrieve's fool with child-a</td></tr><tr><td>    dumb innocent that could not say him nay.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know his</td></tr><tr><td>    brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, is this captain in the Duke of Florence's</td></tr><tr><td>    camp?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. Nay, look not so upon me; we shall hear of your</td></tr><tr><td>    lordship anon.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. What is his reputation with the Duke?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. The Duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of</td></tr><tr><td>    mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him out o' th' band.</td></tr><tr><td>    I think I have his letter in my pocket.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. Marry, we'll search.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there or it</td></tr><tr><td>    is upon a file with the Duke's other letters in my tent.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. Here 'tis; here's a paper. Shall I read it to you?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. I do not know if it be it or no.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Our interpreter does it well.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. Excellently.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER.  [Reads]  'Dian, the Count's a fool, and full of</td></tr><tr><td>    gold.'</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. That is not the Duke's letter, sir; that is an</td></tr><tr><td>    advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one Diana, to take</td></tr><tr><td>    heed of the allurement of one Count Rousillon, a foolish idle</td></tr><tr><td>    boy, but for all that very ruttish. I pray you, sir, put it up</td></tr><tr><td>    again.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. Nay, I'll read it first by your favour.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the behalf</td></tr><tr><td>    of the maid; for I knew the young Count to be a dangerous and</td></tr><tr><td>    lascivious boy, who is a whale to virginity, and devours up all</td></tr><tr><td>    the fry it finds.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Damnable both-sides rogue!</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER.                                         [Reads]</td></tr><tr><td>    'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;</td></tr><tr><td>    After he scores, he never pays the score.</td></tr><tr><td>    Half won is match well made; match, and well make it;</td></tr><tr><td>    He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before.</td></tr><tr><td>    And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this:</td></tr><tr><td>    Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss;</td></tr><tr><td>    For count of this, the Count's a fool, I know it,</td></tr><tr><td>    Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.</td></tr><tr><td>    Thine, as he vow'd to thee in thine ear,</td></tr><tr><td>                                                   PAROLLES.'</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. He shall be whipt through the army with this rhyme in's</td></tr><tr><td>    forehead.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold</td></tr><tr><td>    linguist, and the amnipotent soldier.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. I could endure anything before but a cat, and now he's a</td></tr><tr><td>    cat to me.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. I perceive, sir, by our General's looks we shall be</td></tr><tr><td>    fain to hang you.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. My life, sir, in any case! Not that I am afraid to die,</td></tr><tr><td>    but that, my offences being many, I would repent out the</td></tr><tr><td>    remainder of nature. Let me live, sir, in a dungeon, i' th'</td></tr><tr><td>    stocks, or anywhere, so I may live.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely;</td></tr><tr><td>    therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you have answer'd to</td></tr><tr><td>    his reputation with the Duke, and to his valour; what is his</td></tr><tr><td>    honesty?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister; for rapes</td></tr><tr><td>    and ravishments he parallels Nessus. He professes not keeping of</td></tr><tr><td>    oaths; in breaking 'em he is stronger than Hercules. He will lie,</td></tr><tr><td>    sir, with such volubility that you would think truth were a fool.</td></tr><tr><td>    Drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be swine-drunk; and</td></tr><tr><td>    in his sleep he does little harm, save to his bedclothes about</td></tr><tr><td>    him; but they know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have</td></tr><tr><td>    but little more to say, sir, of his honesty. He has everything</td></tr><tr><td>    that an honest man should not have; what an honest man should</td></tr><tr><td>    have he has nothing.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. I begin to love him for this.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon him! For</td></tr><tr><td>    me, he's more and more a cat.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. What say you to his expertness in war?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Faith, sir, has led the drum before the English</td></tr><tr><td>    tragedians-to belie him I will not-and more of his soldier-ship</td></tr><tr><td>    I know not, except in that country he had the honour to be the</td></tr><tr><td>    officer at a place there called Mile-end to instruct for the</td></tr><tr><td>    doubling of files-I would do the man what honour I can-but of</td></tr><tr><td>    this I am not certain.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. He hath out-villain'd villainy so far that the rarity</td></tr><tr><td>    redeems him.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. A pox on him! he's a cat still.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. His qualities being at this poor price, I need not</td></tr><tr><td>    to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Sir, for a cardecue he will sell the fee-simple of his</td></tr><tr><td>    salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut th' entail from all</td></tr><tr><td>    remainders and a perpetual succession for it perpetually.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain?</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. Why does he ask him of me?</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. What's he?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. E'en a crow o' th' same nest; not altogether so great as</td></tr><tr><td>    the first in goodness, but greater a great deal in evil. He</td></tr><tr><td>    excels his brother for a coward; yet his brother is reputed one</td></tr><tr><td>    of the best that is. In a retreat he outruns any lackey: marry,</td></tr><tr><td>    in coming on he has the cramp.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray</td></tr><tr><td>    the Florentine?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Ay, and the Captain of his Horse, Count Rousillon.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. I'll whisper with the General, and know his</td></tr><tr><td>    pleasure.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES.  [Aside]  I'll no more drumming. A plague of all drums!</td></tr><tr><td>    Only to seem to deserve well, and to beguile the supposition of</td></tr><tr><td>    that lascivious young boy the Count, have I run into this danger.</td></tr><tr><td>    Yet who would have suspected an ambush where I was taken?</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. There is no remedy, sir, but you must die.</td></tr><tr><td>    The General says you that have so traitorously discover'd the</td></tr><tr><td>    secrets of your army, and made such pestiferous reports of men</td></tr><tr><td>    very nobly held, can serve the world for no honest use; therefore</td></tr><tr><td>    you must die. Come, headsman, of with his head.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. That shall you, and take your leave of all your</td></tr><tr><td>    friends.  [Unmuffling him]  So look about you; know you any here?</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Good morrow, noble Captain.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. God bless you, Captain Parolles.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. God save you, noble Captain.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST LORD. Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu? I am</td></tr><tr><td>    for France.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND LORD. Good Captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet</td></tr><tr><td>    you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon? An I were not</td></tr><tr><td>    a very coward I'd compel it of you; but fare you well.</td></tr><tr><td>                                        Exeunt BERTRAM and LORDS</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. You are undone, Captain, all but your scarf; that</td></tr><tr><td>    has a knot on 't yet.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Who cannot be crush'd with a plot?</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. If you could find out a country where but women were</td></tr><tr><td>    that had received so much shame, you might begin an impudent</td></tr><tr><td>    nation. Fare ye well, sir; I am for France too; we shall speak of</td></tr><tr><td>    you there.                                Exit with SOLDIERS</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Yet am I thankful. If my heart were great,</td></tr><tr><td>    'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;</td></tr><tr><td>    But I will eat, and drink, and sleep as soft</td></tr><tr><td>    As captain shall. Simply the thing I am</td></tr><tr><td>    Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,</td></tr><tr><td>    Let him fear this; for it will come to pass</td></tr><tr><td>    That every braggart shall be found an ass.</td></tr><tr><td>    Rust, sword; cool, blushes; and, Parolles, live</td></tr><tr><td>    Safest in shame. Being fool'd, by fool'ry thrive.</td></tr><tr><td>    There's place and means for every man alive.</td></tr><tr><td>    I'll after them.                                        Exit</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>ACT IV SCENE 4.</td></tr><tr><td>The WIDOW'S house</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Enter HELENA, WIDOW, and DIANA</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you!</td></tr><tr><td>    One of the greatest in the Christian world</td></tr><tr><td>    Shall be my surety; fore whose throne 'tis needful,</td></tr><tr><td>    Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel.</td></tr><tr><td>    Time was I did him a desired office,</td></tr><tr><td>    Dear almost as his life; which gratitude</td></tr><tr><td>    Through flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth,</td></tr><tr><td>    And answer 'Thanks.' I duly am inform'd</td></tr><tr><td>    His Grace is at Marseilles, to which place</td></tr><tr><td>    We have convenient convoy. You must know</td></tr><tr><td>    I am supposed dead. The army breaking,</td></tr><tr><td>    My husband hies him home; where, heaven aiding,</td></tr><tr><td>    And by the leave of my good lord the King,</td></tr><tr><td>    We'll be before our welcome.</td></tr><tr><td>  WIDOW. Gentle madam,</td></tr><tr><td>    You never had a servant to whose trust</td></tr><tr><td>    Your business was more welcome.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Nor you, mistress,</td></tr><tr><td>    Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour</td></tr><tr><td>    To recompense your love. Doubt not but heaven</td></tr><tr><td>    Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,</td></tr><tr><td>    As it hath fated her to be my motive</td></tr><tr><td>    And helper to a husband. But, O strange men!</td></tr><tr><td>    That can such sweet use make of what they hate,</td></tr><tr><td>    When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts</td></tr><tr><td>    Defiles the pitchy night. So lust doth play</td></tr><tr><td>    With what it loathes, for that which is away.</td></tr><tr><td>    But more of this hereafter. You, Diana,</td></tr><tr><td>    Under my poor instructions yet must suffer</td></tr><tr><td>    Something in my behalf.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. Let death and honesty</td></tr><tr><td>    Go with your impositions, I am yours</td></tr><tr><td>    Upon your will to suffer.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Yet, I pray you:</td></tr><tr><td>    But with the word the time will bring on summer,</td></tr><tr><td>    When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns</td></tr><tr><td>    And be as sweet as sharp. We must away;</td></tr><tr><td>    Our waggon is prepar'd, and time revives us.</td></tr><tr><td>    All's Well that Ends Well. Still the fine's the crown.</td></tr><tr><td>    Whate'er the course, the end is the renown.           Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>ACT IV SCENE 5.</td></tr><tr><td>Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Enter COUNTESS, LAFEU, and CLOWN</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. No, no, no, son was misled with a snipt-taffeta fellow</td></tr><tr><td>    there, whose villainous saffron would have made all the unbak'd</td></tr><tr><td>    and doughy youth of a nation in his colour. Your daughter-in-law</td></tr><tr><td>    had been alive at this hour, and your son here at home, more</td></tr><tr><td>    advanc'd by the King than by that red-tail'd humble-bee I speak</td></tr><tr><td>    of.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. I would I had not known him. It was the death of the most</td></tr><tr><td>    virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating. If</td></tr><tr><td>    she had partaken of my flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a</td></tr><tr><td>    mother. I could not have owed her a more rooted love.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. 'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady. We may pick a thousand</td></tr><tr><td>    sallets ere we light on such another herb.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. Indeed, sir, she was the sweet-marjoram of the sallet, or,</td></tr><tr><td>    rather, the herb of grace.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. They are not sallet-herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much skill in</td></tr><tr><td>    grass.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Whether dost thou profess thyself-a knave or a fool?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Your distinction?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. I would cozen the man of his wife, and do his service.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. So you were a knave at his service, indeed.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. I will subscribe for thee; thou art both knave and fool.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. At your service.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. No, no, no.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as great a</td></tr><tr><td>    prince as you are.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Who's that? A Frenchman?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. Faith, sir, 'a has an English name; but his fisnomy is more</td></tr><tr><td>    hotter in France than there.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. What prince is that?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. The Black Prince, sir; alias, the Prince of Darkness; alias,</td></tr><tr><td>    the devil.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Hold thee, there's my purse. I give thee not this to suggest</td></tr><tr><td>    thee from thy master thou talk'st of; serve him still.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a great fire;</td></tr><tr><td>    and the master I speak of ever keeps a good fire. But, sure, he</td></tr><tr><td>    is the prince of the world; let his nobility remain in's court. I</td></tr><tr><td>    am for the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be too</td></tr><tr><td>    little for pomp to enter. Some that humble themselves may; but</td></tr><tr><td>    the many will be too chill and tender: and they'll be for the</td></tr><tr><td>    flow'ry way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I tell thee</td></tr><tr><td>    so before, because I would not fall out with thee. Go thy ways;</td></tr><tr><td>    let my horses be well look'd to, without any tricks.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be jades'</td></tr><tr><td>    tricks, which are their own right by the law of nature.</td></tr><tr><td> Exit</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. A shrewd knave, and an unhappy.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. So 'a is. My lord that's gone made himself much  sport</td></tr><tr><td>    out of him. By his authority he remains here, which he thinks is</td></tr><tr><td>    a patent for his sauciness; and indeed he has no pace, but runs</td></tr><tr><td>    where he will.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. I like him well; 'tis not amiss. And I was about to tell</td></tr><tr><td>    you, since I heard of the good lady's death, and that my lord</td></tr><tr><td>    your son was upon his return home, I moved the King my master to</td></tr><tr><td>    speak in the behalf of my daughter; which, in the minority of</td></tr><tr><td>    them both, his Majesty out of a self-gracious remembrance did</td></tr><tr><td>    first propose. His Highness hath promis'd me to do it; and, to</td></tr><tr><td>    stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against your son, there</td></tr><tr><td>    is no fitter matter. How does your ladyship like it?</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. With very much content, my lord; and I wish it happily</td></tr><tr><td>    effected.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. His Highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able body as</td></tr><tr><td>    when he number'd thirty; 'a will be here to-morrow, or I am</td></tr><tr><td>    deceiv'd by him that in such intelligence hath seldom fail'd.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. It rejoices me that I hope I shall see him ere I die.</td></tr><tr><td>    I have letters that my son will be here to-night. I shall beseech</td></tr><tr><td>    your lordship to remain with me tal they meet together.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might safely be</td></tr><tr><td>    admitted.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. You need but plead your honourable privilege.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but, I thank my</td></tr><tr><td>    God, it holds yet.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                         Re-enter CLOWN</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of velvet</td></tr><tr><td>    on's face; whether there be a scar under 't or no, the velvet</td></tr><tr><td>    knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of velvet. His left cheek is a</td></tr><tr><td>    cheek of two pile and a half, but his right cheek is worn bare.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good liv'ry of</td></tr><tr><td>    honour; so belike is that.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. But it is your carbonado'd face.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Let us go see your son, I pray you;</td></tr><tr><td>    I long to talk with the young noble soldier.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. Faith, there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine hats, and</td></tr><tr><td>    most courteous feathers, which bow the head and nod at every man.</td></tr><tr><td>                                                          Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td><<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM</td></tr><tr><td>SHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS</td></tr><tr><td>PROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF ILLINOIS BENEDICTINE COLLEGE</td></tr><tr><td>WITH PERMISSION.

But this exceeding posting day and night</td></tr><tr><td>    Must wear your spirits low; we cannot help it.</td></tr><tr><td>    But since you have made the days and nights as one,</td></tr><tr><td>    To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,</td></tr><tr><td>    Be bold you do so grow in my requital</td></tr><tr><td>    As nothing can unroot you.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                      Enter a GENTLEMAN</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>    In happy time!</td></tr><tr><td>    This man may help me to his Majesty's ear,</td></tr><tr><td>    If he would spend his power. God save you, sir.</td></tr><tr><td>  GENTLEMAN. And you.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.</td></tr><tr><td>  GENTLEMAN. I have been sometimes there.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. I do presume, sir, that you are not fall'n</td></tr><tr><td>    From the report that goes upon your goodness;</td></tr><tr><td>    And therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which lay nice manners by, I put you to</td></tr><tr><td>    The use of your own virtues, for the which</td></tr><tr><td>    I shall continue thankful.</td></tr><tr><td>  GENTLEMAN. What's your will?</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. That it will please you</td></tr><tr><td>    To give this poor petition to the King;</td></tr><tr><td>    And aid me with that store of power you have</td></tr><tr><td>    To come into his presence.</td></tr><tr><td>  GENTLEMAN. The King's not here.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. Not here, sir?</td></tr><tr><td>  GENTLEMAN. Not indeed.</td></tr><tr><td>    He hence remov'd last night, and with more haste</td></tr><tr><td>    Than is his use.</td></tr><tr><td>  WIDOW. Lord, how we lose our pains!</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. All's Well That Ends Well yet,</td></tr><tr><td>    Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.</td></tr><tr><td>    I do beseech you, whither is he gone?</td></tr><tr><td>  GENTLEMAN. Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon;</td></tr><tr><td>    Whither I am going.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. I do beseech you, sir,</td></tr><tr><td>    Since you are like to see the King before me,</td></tr><tr><td>    Commend the paper to his gracious hand;</td></tr><tr><td>    Which I presume shall render you no blame,</td></tr><tr><td>    But rather make you thank your pains for it.</td></tr><tr><td>    I will come after you with what good speed</td></tr><tr><td>    Our means will make us means.</td></tr><tr><td>  GENTLEMAN. This I'll do for you.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. And you shall find yourself to be well thank'd,</td></tr><tr><td>    Whate'er falls more. We must to horse again;</td></tr><tr><td>    Go, go, provide.                                      Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>ACT V SCENE 2.</td></tr><tr><td>Rousillon. The inner court of the COUNT'S palace</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Enter CLOWN and PAROLLES</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafeu this letter. I</td></tr><tr><td>    have ere now, sir, been better known to you, when I have held</td></tr><tr><td>    familiarity with fresher clothes; but I am now, sir, muddied in</td></tr><tr><td>    Fortune's mood, and smell somewhat strong of her strong</td></tr><tr><td>    displeasure.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. Truly, Fortune's displeasure is but sluttish, if it smell</td></tr><tr><td>    so strongly as thou speak'st of. I will henceforth eat no fish</td></tr><tr><td>    of Fortune's butt'ring. Prithee, allow the wind.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir; I spake but by</td></tr><tr><td>    a metaphor.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my nose; or</td></tr><tr><td>    against any man's metaphor. Prithee, get thee further.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOWN. Foh! prithee stand away. A paper from Fortune's close-stool</td></tr><tr><td>    to give to a nobleman! Look here he comes himself.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                           Enter LAFEU</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>    Here is a pur of Fortune's, sir, or of Fortune's cat, but not</td></tr><tr><td>    a musk-cat, that has fall'n into the unclean fishpond of her</td></tr><tr><td>    displeasure, and, as he says, is muddied withal. Pray you, sir,</td></tr><tr><td>    use the carp as you may; for he looks like a poor, decayed,</td></tr><tr><td>    ingenious, foolish, rascally knave. I do pity his distress</td></tr><tr><td>    in my similes of comfort, and leave him to your lordship.</td></tr><tr><td> Exit</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. My lord, I am a man whom Fortune hath cruelly scratch'd.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. And what would you have me to do? 'Tis too late to pare her</td></tr><tr><td>    nails now. Wherein have you played the knave with Fortune, that</td></tr><tr><td>    she should scratch you, who of herself is a good lady and would</td></tr><tr><td>    not have knaves thrive long under her? There's a cardecue for</td></tr><tr><td>    you. Let the justices make you and Fortune friends; I am for</td></tr><tr><td>    other business.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. I beseech your honour to hear me one single word.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. You beg a single penny more; come, you shall ha't; save your</td></tr><tr><td>    word.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. My name, my good lord, is Parolles.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. You beg more than word then. Cox my passion! give me your</td></tr><tr><td>    hand. How does your drum?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. O my good lord, you were the first that found me.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Was I, in sooth? And I was the first that lost thee.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace, for</td></tr><tr><td>    you did bring me out.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Out upon thee, knave! Dost thou put upon me at once both the</td></tr><tr><td>    office of God and the devil? One brings the in grace, and the</td></tr><tr><td>    other brings thee out.    [Trumpets sound]  The King's coming; I</td></tr><tr><td>    know by his trumpets. Sirrah, inquire further after me; I had</td></tr><tr><td>    talk of you last night. Though you are a fool and a knave, you</td></tr><tr><td>    shall eat. Go to; follow.</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. I praise God for you.                         Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>ACT V SCENE 3.</td></tr><tr><td>Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Flourish. Enter KING, COUNTESS, LAFEU, the two FRENCH LORDS, with ATTENDANTS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  KING. We lost a jewel of her, and our esteem</td></tr><tr><td>    Was made much poorer by it; but your son,</td></tr><tr><td>    As mad in folly, lack'd the sense to know</td></tr><tr><td>    Her estimation home.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. 'Tis past, my liege;</td></tr><tr><td>    And I beseech your Majesty to make it</td></tr><tr><td>    Natural rebellion, done i' th' blaze of youth,</td></tr><tr><td>    When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,</td></tr><tr><td>    O'erbears it and burns on.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. My honour'd lady,</td></tr><tr><td>    I have forgiven and forgotten all;</td></tr><tr><td>    Though my revenges were high bent upon him</td></tr><tr><td>    And watch'd the time to shoot.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. This I must say-</td></tr><tr><td>    But first, I beg my pardon: the young lord</td></tr><tr><td>    Did to his Majesty, his mother, and his lady,</td></tr><tr><td>    Offence of mighty note; but to himself</td></tr><tr><td>    The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife</td></tr><tr><td>    Whose beauty did astonish the survey</td></tr><tr><td>    Of richest eyes; whose words all ears took captive;</td></tr><tr><td>    Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve</td></tr><tr><td>    Humbly call'd mistress.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Praising what is lost</td></tr><tr><td>    Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;</td></tr><tr><td>    We are reconcil'd, and the first view shall kill</td></tr><tr><td>    All repetition. Let him not ask our pardon;</td></tr><tr><td>    The nature of his great offence is dead,</td></tr><tr><td>    And deeper than oblivion do we bury</td></tr><tr><td>    Th' incensing relics of it; let him approach,</td></tr><tr><td>    A stranger, no offender; and inform him</td></tr><tr><td>    So 'tis our will he should.</td></tr><tr><td>  GENTLEMAN. I shall, my liege.                 Exit GENTLEMAN</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. What says he to your daughter? Have you spoke?</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. All that he is hath reference to your Highness.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me</td></tr><tr><td>    That sets him high in fame.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                          Enter BERTRAM</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. He looks well on 't.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. I am not a day of season,</td></tr><tr><td>    For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail</td></tr><tr><td>    In me at once. But to the brightest beams</td></tr><tr><td>    Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;</td></tr><tr><td>    The time is fair again.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. My high-repented blames,</td></tr><tr><td>    Dear sovereign, pardon to me.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. All is whole;</td></tr><tr><td>    Not one word more of the consumed time.</td></tr><tr><td>    Let's take the instant by the forward top;</td></tr><tr><td>    For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees</td></tr><tr><td>    Th' inaudible and noiseless foot of Time</td></tr><tr><td>    Steals ere we can effect them. You remember</td></tr><tr><td>    The daughter of this lord?</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Admiringly, my liege. At first</td></tr><tr><td>    I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart</td></tr><tr><td>    Durst make too bold herald of my tongue;</td></tr><tr><td>    Where the impression of mine eye infixing,</td></tr><tr><td>    Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which warp'd the line of every other favour,</td></tr><tr><td>    Scorn'd a fair colour or express'd it stol'n,</td></tr><tr><td>    Extended or contracted all proportions</td></tr><tr><td>    To a most hideous object. Thence it came</td></tr><tr><td>    That she whom all men prais'd, and whom myself,</td></tr><tr><td>    Since I have lost, have lov'd, was in mine eye</td></tr><tr><td>    The dust that did offend it.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Well excus'd.</td></tr><tr><td>    That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away</td></tr><tr><td>    From the great compt; but love that comes too late,</td></tr><tr><td>    Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,</td></tr><tr><td>    To the great sender turns a sour offence,</td></tr><tr><td>    Crying 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults</td></tr><tr><td>    Make trivial price of serious things we have,</td></tr><tr><td>    Not knowing them until we know their grave.</td></tr><tr><td>    Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,</td></tr><tr><td>    Destroy our friends, and after weep their dust;</td></tr><tr><td>    Our own love waking cries to see what's done,</td></tr><tr><td>    While shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon.</td></tr><tr><td>    Be this sweet Helen's knell. And now forget her.</td></tr><tr><td>    Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin.</td></tr><tr><td>    The main consents are had; and here we'll stay</td></tr><tr><td>    To see our widower's second marriage-day.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!</td></tr><tr><td>    Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. Come on, my son, in whom my house's name</td></tr><tr><td>    Must be digested; give a favour from you,</td></tr><tr><td>    To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,</td></tr><tr><td>    That she may quickly come.</td></tr><tr><td>                                          [BERTRAM gives a ring]</td></tr><tr><td>    By my old beard,</td></tr><tr><td>    And ev'ry hair that's on 't, Helen, that's dead,</td></tr><tr><td>    Was a sweet creature; such a ring as this,</td></tr><tr><td>    The last that e'er I took her leave at court,</td></tr><tr><td>    I saw upon her finger.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. Hers it was not.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,</td></tr><tr><td>    While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.</td></tr><tr><td>    This ring was mine; and when I gave it Helen</td></tr><tr><td>    I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood</td></tr><tr><td>    Necessitied to help, that by this token</td></tr><tr><td>    I would relieve her. Had you that craft to reave her</td></tr><tr><td>    Of what should stead her most?</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. My gracious sovereign,</td></tr><tr><td>    Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,</td></tr><tr><td>    The ring was never hers.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Son, on my life,</td></tr><tr><td>    I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it</td></tr><tr><td>    At her life's rate.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. I am sure I saw her wear it.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. You are deceiv'd, my lord; she never saw it.</td></tr><tr><td>    In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,</td></tr><tr><td>    Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name</td></tr><tr><td>    Of her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought</td></tr><tr><td>    I stood engag'd; but when I had subscrib'd</td></tr><tr><td>    To mine own fortune, and inform'd her fully</td></tr><tr><td>    I could not answer in that course of honour</td></tr><tr><td>    As she had made the overture, she ceas'd,</td></tr><tr><td>    In heavy satisfaction, and would never</td></tr><tr><td>    Receive the ring again.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Plutus himself,</td></tr><tr><td>    That knows the tinct and multiplying med'cine,</td></tr><tr><td>    Hath not in nature's mystery more science</td></tr><tr><td>    Than I have in this ring. 'Twas mine, 'twas Helen's,</td></tr><tr><td>    Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know</td></tr><tr><td>    That you are well acquainted with yourself,</td></tr><tr><td>    Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement</td></tr><tr><td>    You got it from her. She call'd the saints to surety</td></tr><tr><td>    That she would never put it from her finger</td></tr><tr><td>    Unless she gave it to yourself in bed-</td></tr><tr><td>    Where you have never come- or sent it us</td></tr><tr><td>    Upon her great disaster.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. She never saw it.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;</td></tr><tr><td>    And mak'st conjectural fears to come into me</td></tr><tr><td>    Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove</td></tr><tr><td>    That thou art so inhuman- 'twill not prove so.</td></tr><tr><td>    And yet I know not- thou didst hate her deadly,</td></tr><tr><td>    And she is dead; which nothing, but to close</td></tr><tr><td>    Her eyes myself, could win me to believe</td></tr><tr><td>    More than to see this ring. Take him away.</td></tr><tr><td>                                          [GUARDS seize BERTRAM]</td></tr><tr><td>    My fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall,</td></tr><tr><td>    Shall tax my fears of little vanity,</td></tr><tr><td>    Having vainly fear'd too little. Away with him.</td></tr><tr><td>    We'll sift this matter further.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. If you shall prove</td></tr><tr><td>    This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy</td></tr><tr><td>    Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,</td></tr><tr><td>    Where she yet never was.                       Exit, guarded</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                        Enter a GENTLEMAN</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  GENTLEMAN. Gracious sovereign,</td></tr><tr><td>    Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:</td></tr><tr><td>    Here's a petition from a Florentine,</td></tr><tr><td>    Who hath, for four or five removes, come short</td></tr><tr><td>    To tender it herself. I undertook it,</td></tr><tr><td>    Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech</td></tr><tr><td>    Of the poor suppliant, who by this, I know,</td></tr><tr><td>    Is here attending; her business looks in her</td></tr><tr><td>    With an importing visage; and she told me</td></tr><tr><td>    In a sweet verbal brief it did concern</td></tr><tr><td>    Your Highness with herself.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING.  [Reads the letter]  'Upon his many protestations to marry me</td></tr><tr><td>    when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won me. Now is the</td></tr><tr><td>    Count Rousillon a widower; his vows are forfeited to me, and my</td></tr><tr><td>    honour's paid to him. He stole from Florence, taking no leave,</td></tr><tr><td>    and I follow him to his country for justice. Grant it me, O King!</td></tr><tr><td>    in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer flourishes, and a poor</td></tr><tr><td>    maid is undone.</td></tr><tr><td>                                                DIANA CAPILET.'</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for this.</td></tr><tr><td>    I'll none of him.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. The heavens have thought well on thee, Lafeu,</td></tr><tr><td>    To bring forth this discov'ry. Seek these suitors.</td></tr><tr><td>    Go speedily, and bring again the Count.</td></tr><tr><td>                                               Exeunt ATTENDANTS</td></tr><tr><td>    I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,</td></tr><tr><td>    Was foully snatch'd.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. Now, justice on the doers!</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                       Enter BERTRAM, guarded</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  KING. I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you.</td></tr><tr><td>    And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,</td></tr><tr><td>    Yet you desire to marry.</td></tr><tr><td>                                           Enter WIDOW and DIANA</td></tr><tr><td>    What woman's that?</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,</td></tr><tr><td>    Derived from the ancient Capilet.</td></tr><tr><td>    My suit, as I do understand, you know,</td></tr><tr><td>    And therefore know how far I may be pitied.</td></tr><tr><td>  WIDOW. I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour</td></tr><tr><td>    Both suffer under this complaint we bring,</td></tr><tr><td>    And both shall cease, without your remedy.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Come hither, Count; do you know these women?</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. My lord, I neither can nor will deny</td></tr><tr><td>    But that I know them. Do they charge me further?</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. Why do you look so strange upon your wife?</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. She's none of mine, my lord.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. If you shall marry,</td></tr><tr><td>    You give away this hand, and that is mine;</td></tr><tr><td>    You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine;</td></tr><tr><td>    You give away myself, which is known mine;</td></tr><tr><td>    For I by vow am so embodied yours</td></tr><tr><td>    That she which marries you must marry me,</td></tr><tr><td>    Either both or none.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU.  [To BERTRAM]  Your reputation comes too short for</td></tr><tr><td>    my daughter; you are no husband for her.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. My lord, this is a fond and desp'rate creature</td></tr><tr><td>    Whom sometime I have laugh'd with. Let your Highness</td></tr><tr><td>    Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour</td></tr><tr><td>    Than for to think that I would sink it here.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend</td></tr><tr><td>    Till your deeds gain them. Fairer prove your honour</td></tr><tr><td>    Than in my thought it lies!</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. Good my lord,</td></tr><tr><td>    Ask him upon his oath if he does think</td></tr><tr><td>    He had not my virginity.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. What say'st thou to her?</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. She's impudent, my lord,</td></tr><tr><td>    And was a common gamester to the camp.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so</td></tr><tr><td>    He might have bought me at a common price.</td></tr><tr><td>    Do not believe him. o, behold this ring,</td></tr><tr><td>    Whose high respect and rich validity</td></tr><tr><td>    Did lack a parallel; yet, for all that,</td></tr><tr><td>    He gave it to a commoner o' th' camp,</td></tr><tr><td>    If I be one.</td></tr><tr><td>  COUNTESS. He blushes, and 'tis it.</td></tr><tr><td>    Of six preceding ancestors, that gem</td></tr><tr><td>    Conferr'd by testament to th' sequent issue,</td></tr><tr><td>    Hath it been ow'd and worn. This is his wife:</td></tr><tr><td>    That ring's a thousand proofs.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Methought you said</td></tr><tr><td>    You saw one here in court could witness it.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. I did, my lord, but loath am to produce</td></tr><tr><td>    So bad an instrument; his name's Parolles.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. I saw the man to-day, if man he be.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Find him, and bring him hither.        Exit an ATTENDANT</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. What of him?</td></tr><tr><td>    He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,</td></tr><tr><td>    With all the spots o' th' world tax'd and debauch'd,</td></tr><tr><td>    Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.</td></tr><tr><td>    Am I or that or this for what he'll utter</td></tr><tr><td>    That will speak anything?</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. She hath that ring of yours.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. I think she has. Certain it is I lik'd her,</td></tr><tr><td>    And boarded her i' th' wanton way of youth.</td></tr><tr><td>    She knew her distance, and did angle for me,</td></tr><tr><td>    Madding my eagerness with her restraint,</td></tr><tr><td>    As all impediments in fancy's course</td></tr><tr><td>    Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,</td></tr><tr><td>    Her infinite cunning with her modern grace</td></tr><tr><td>    Subdu'd me to her rate. She got the ring;</td></tr><tr><td>    And I had that which any inferior might</td></tr><tr><td>    At market-price have bought.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. I must be patient.</td></tr><tr><td>    You that have turn'd off a first so noble wife</td></tr><tr><td>    May justly diet me. I pray you yet-</td></tr><tr><td>    Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband-</td></tr><tr><td>    Send for your ring, I will return it home,</td></tr><tr><td>    And give me mine again.</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. I have it not.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. What ring was yours, I pray you?</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. Sir, much like</td></tr><tr><td>    The same upon your finger.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Know you this ring? This ring was his of late.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. And this was it I gave him, being abed.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. The story, then, goes false you threw it him</td></tr><tr><td>    Out of a casement.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. I have spoke the truth.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                       Enter PAROLLES</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. You boggle shrewdly; every feather starts you.</td></tr><tr><td>    Is this the man you speak of?</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. Ay, my lord.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Tell me, sirrah-but tell me true I charge you,</td></tr><tr><td>    Not fearing the displeasure of your master,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which, on your just proceeding, I'll keep off-</td></tr><tr><td>    By him and by this woman here what know you?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. So please your Majesty, my master hath been an honourable</td></tr><tr><td>    gentleman; tricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen have.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Come, come, to th' purpose. Did he love this woman?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. How, I pray you?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. How is that?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. He lov'd her, sir, and lov'd her not.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. As thou art a knave and no knave.</td></tr><tr><td>    What an equivocal companion is this!</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. I am a poor man, and at your Majesty's command.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. Do you know he promis'd me marriage?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Faith, I know more than I'll speak.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. But wilt thou not speak all thou know'st?</td></tr><tr><td>  PAROLLES. Yes, so please your Majesty. I did go between them, as I</td></tr><tr><td>    said; but more than that, he loved her-for indeed he was mad for</td></tr><tr><td>    her, and talk'd of Satan, and of Limbo, and of Furies, and I know</td></tr><tr><td>    not what. Yet I was in that credit with them at that time that I</td></tr><tr><td>    knew of their going to bed; and of other motions, as promising</td></tr><tr><td>    her marriage, and things which would derive me ill will to speak</td></tr><tr><td>    of; therefore I will not speak what I know.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say they are</td></tr><tr><td>    married; but thou art too fine in thy evidence; therefore stand</td></tr><tr><td>    aside.</td></tr><tr><td>    This ring, you say, was yours?</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. Ay, my good lord.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Where did you buy it? Or who gave it you?</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Who lent it you?</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. It was not lent me neither.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Where did you find it then?</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. I found it not.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. If it were yours by none of all these ways,</td></tr><tr><td>    How could you give it him?</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. I never gave it him.</td></tr><tr><td>  LAFEU. This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes of and on at</td></tr><tr><td>    pleasure.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. This ring was mine, I gave it his first wife.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA.

I'll never tell you.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Take her away.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. I'll put in bail, my liege.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. I think thee now some common customer.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.</td></tr><tr><td>  KING. Wherefore hast thou accus'd him all this while?</td></tr><tr><td>  DIANA. Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty.</td></tr><tr><td>    He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't:</td></tr><tr><td>    I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.</td></tr><tr><td>    Great King, I am no strumpet, by my life;</td></tr><tr><td>    I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.</td></tr><tr><td>                                             [Pointing to LAFEU]</td></tr><tr><td>  KING.

Both, both; o, pardon!</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA. O, my good lord, when I was like this maid,</td></tr><tr><td>    I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring,</td></tr><tr><td>    And, look you, here's your letter. This it says:</td></tr><tr><td>    'When from my finger you can get this ring,</td></tr><tr><td>    And are by me with child,' etc. This is done.</td></tr><tr><td>    Will you be mine now you are doubly won?</td></tr><tr><td>  BERTRAM. If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,</td></tr><tr><td>    I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.</td></tr><tr><td>  HELENA.

SCENE I.</td></tr><tr><td>Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILO</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  PHILO. Nay, but this dotage of our general's</td></tr><tr><td>    O'erflows the measure. Those his goodly eyes,</td></tr><tr><td>    That o'er the files and musters of the war</td></tr><tr><td>    Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,</td></tr><tr><td>    The office and devotion of their view</td></tr><tr><td>    Upon a tawny front. His captain's heart,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst</td></tr><tr><td>    The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,</td></tr><tr><td>    And is become the bellows and the fan</td></tr><tr><td>    To cool a gipsy's lust.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>     Flourish.

Behold and see.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. If it be love indeed, tell me how much.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. I'll set a bourn how far to be belov'd.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                       Enter a MESSENGER</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. News, my good lord, from Rome.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Grates me the sum.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Nay, hear them, Antony.</td></tr><tr><td>    Fulvia perchance is angry; or who knows</td></tr><tr><td>    If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent</td></tr><tr><td>    His pow'rful mandate to you: 'Do this or this;</td></tr><tr><td>    Take in that kingdom and enfranchise that;</td></tr><tr><td>    Perform't, or else we damn thee.'</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. How, my love?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Perchance? Nay, and most like,</td></tr><tr><td>    You must not stay here longer; your dismission</td></tr><tr><td>    Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.</td></tr><tr><td>    Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? Both?</td></tr><tr><td>    Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's Queen,</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine</td></tr><tr><td>    Is Caesar's homager. Else so thy cheek pays shame</td></tr><tr><td>    When shrill-tongu'd Fulvia scolds. The messengers!</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch</td></tr><tr><td>    Of the rang'd empire fall! Here is my space.</td></tr><tr><td>    Kingdoms are clay; our dungy earth alike</td></tr><tr><td>    Feeds beast as man. The nobleness of life</td></tr><tr><td>    Is to do thus [emhracing], when such a mutual pair</td></tr><tr><td>    And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,</td></tr><tr><td>    On pain of punishment, the world to weet</td></tr><tr><td>    We stand up peerless.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Excellent falsehood!</td></tr><tr><td>    Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?</td></tr><tr><td>    I'll seem the fool I am not. Antony</td></tr><tr><td>    Will be himself.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. But stirr'd by Cleopatra.</td></tr><tr><td>    Now for the love of Love and her soft hours,</td></tr><tr><td>    Let's not confound the time with conference harsh;</td></tr><tr><td>    There's not a minute of our lives should stretch</td></tr><tr><td>    Without some pleasure now. What sport to-night?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Hear the ambassadors.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Fie, wrangling queen!</td></tr><tr><td>    Whom everything becomes- to chide, to laugh,</td></tr><tr><td>    To weep; whose every passion fully strives</td></tr><tr><td>    To make itself in thee fair and admir'd.</td></tr><tr><td>    No messenger but thine, and all alone</td></tr><tr><td>    To-night we'll wander through the streets and note</td></tr><tr><td>    The qualities of people. Come, my queen;</td></tr><tr><td>    Last night you did desire it. Speak not to us.</td></tr><tr><td>                     Exeunt ANTONY and CLEOPATRA, with the train</td></tr><tr><td>  DEMETRIUS. Is Caesar with Antonius priz'd so slight?</td></tr><tr><td>  PHILO. Sir, sometimes when he is not Antony,</td></tr><tr><td>    He comes too short of that great property</td></tr><tr><td>    Which still should go with Antony.</td></tr><tr><td>  DEMETRIUS. I am full sorry</td></tr><tr><td>    That he approves the common liar, who</td></tr><tr><td>    Thus speaks of him at Rome; but I will hope</td></tr><tr><td>    Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!            Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>SCENE II.</td></tr><tr><td>Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Enter CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, and a SOOTHSAYER</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost</td></tr><tr><td>    most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer that you prais'd so</td></tr><tr><td>    to th' Queen? O that I knew this husband, which you say must</td></tr><tr><td>    charge his horns with garlands!</td></tr><tr><td>  ALEXAS. Soothsayer!</td></tr><tr><td>  SOOTHSAYER. Your will?</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?</td></tr><tr><td>  SOOTHSAYER. In nature's infinite book of secrecy</td></tr><tr><td>    A little I can read.</td></tr><tr><td>  ALEXAS. Show him your hand.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                       Enter ENOBARBUS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough</td></tr><tr><td>    Cleopatra's health to drink.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Good, sir, give me good fortune.</td></tr><tr><td>  SOOTHSAYER. I make not, but foresee.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Pray, then, foresee me one.</td></tr><tr><td>  SOOTHSAYER. You shall be yet far fairer than you are.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. He means in flesh.</td></tr><tr><td>  IRAS. No, you shall paint when you are old.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Wrinkles forbid!</td></tr><tr><td>  ALEXAS. Vex not his prescience; be attentive.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Hush!</td></tr><tr><td>  SOOTHSAYER. You shall be more beloving than beloved.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. I had rather heat my liver with drinking.</td></tr><tr><td>  ALEXAS. Nay, hear him.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married to</td></tr><tr><td>    three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all. Let me have a</td></tr><tr><td>    child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage. Find me to</td></tr><tr><td>    marry me with Octavius Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.</td></tr><tr><td>  SOOTHSAYER. You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. O, excellent! I love long life better than figs.</td></tr><tr><td>  SOOTHSAYER. You have seen and prov'd a fairer former fortune</td></tr><tr><td>    Than that which is to approach.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Then belike my children shall have no names.</td></tr><tr><td>    Prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?</td></tr><tr><td>  SOOTHSAYER. If every of your wishes had a womb,</td></tr><tr><td>    And fertile every wish, a million.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.</td></tr><tr><td>  ALEXAS. You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Nay, come, tell Iras hers.</td></tr><tr><td>  ALEXAS. We'll know all our fortunes.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall be-</td></tr><tr><td>    drunk to bed.</td></tr><tr><td>  IRAS. There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.</td></tr><tr><td>  IRAS. Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I</td></tr><tr><td>    cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee, tell her but worky-day fortune.</td></tr><tr><td>  SOOTHSAYER. Your fortunes are alike.</td></tr><tr><td>  IRAS. But how, but how? Give me particulars.</td></tr><tr><td>  SOOTHSAYER. I have said.</td></tr><tr><td>  IRAS. Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I,</td></tr><tr><td>    where would you choose it?</td></tr><tr><td>  IRAS. Not in my husband's nose.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas- come, his</td></tr><tr><td>    fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman that cannot go,</td></tr><tr><td>    sweet Isis, I beseech thee! And let her die too, and give him a</td></tr><tr><td>    worse! And let worse follow worse, till the worst of all follow</td></tr><tr><td>    him laughing to his grave, fiftyfold a cuckold! Good Isis, hear</td></tr><tr><td>    me this prayer, though thou deny me a matter of more weight; good</td></tr><tr><td>    Isis, I beseech thee!</td></tr><tr><td>  IRAS. Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! For, as</td></tr><tr><td>    it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wiv'd, so it is</td></tr><tr><td>    a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded. Therefore,</td></tr><tr><td>    dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly!</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Amen.</td></tr><tr><td>  ALEXAS. Lo now, if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold, they</td></tr><tr><td>    would make themselves whores but they'ld do't!</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                          Enter CLEOPATRA</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Hush! Here comes Antony.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Not he; the Queen.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Saw you my lord?</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. No, lady.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Was he not here?</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. No, madam.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. He was dispos'd to mirth; but on the sudden</td></tr><tr><td>    A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Madam?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Seek him, and bring him hither. Where's Alexas?</td></tr><tr><td>  ALEXAS. Here, at your service. My lord approaches.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>          Enter ANTONY, with a MESSENGER and attendants</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. We will not look upon him. Go with us.</td></tr><tr><td>                       Exeunt CLEOPATRA, ENOBARBUS, and the rest</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Against my brother Lucius?</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. Ay.</td></tr><tr><td>    But soon that war had end, and the time's state</td></tr><tr><td>    Made friends of them, jointing their force 'gainst Caesar,</td></tr><tr><td>    Whose better issue in the war from Italy</td></tr><tr><td>    Upon the first encounter drave them.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Well, what worst?</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. The nature of bad news infects the teller.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. When it concerns the fool or coward. On!</td></tr><tr><td>    Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:</td></tr><tr><td>    Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,</td></tr><tr><td>    I hear him as he flatter'd.</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. Labienus-</td></tr><tr><td>    This is stiff news- hath with his Parthian force</td></tr><tr><td>    Extended Asia from Euphrates,</td></tr><tr><td>    His conquering banner shook from Syria</td></tr><tr><td>    To Lydia and to Ionia,</td></tr><tr><td>    Whilst-</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Antony, thou wouldst say.</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. O, my lord!</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Speak to me home; mince not the general tongue;</td></tr><tr><td>    Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome.</td></tr><tr><td>    Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase, and taunt my faults</td></tr><tr><td>    With such full licence as both truth and malice</td></tr><tr><td>    Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds</td></tr><tr><td>    When our quick minds lie still, and our ills told us</td></tr><tr><td>    Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. At your noble pleasure.                        Exit</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST ATTENDANT. The man from Sicyon- is there such an one?</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND ATTENDANT. He stays upon your will.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Let him appear.</td></tr><tr><td>    These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,</td></tr><tr><td>    Or lose myself in dotage.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                 Enter another MESSENGER with a letter</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>    What are you?</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND MESSENGER. Fulvia thy wife is dead.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Where died she?</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND MESSENGER. In Sicyon.</td></tr><tr><td>    Her length of sickness, with what else more serious</td></tr><tr><td>    Importeth thee to know, this bears.       [Gives the letter]</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Forbear me.                             Exit MESSENGER</td></tr><tr><td>    There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it.</td></tr><tr><td>    What our contempts doth often hurl from us</td></tr><tr><td>    We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,</td></tr><tr><td>    By revolution low'ring, does become</td></tr><tr><td>    The opposite of itself. She's good, being gone;</td></tr><tr><td>    The hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on.</td></tr><tr><td>    I must from this enchanting queen break off.</td></tr><tr><td>    Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,</td></tr><tr><td>    My idleness doth hatch. How now, Enobarbus!</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                    Re-enter ENOBARBUS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. What's your pleasure, sir?</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. I must with haste from hence.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Why, then we kill all our women. We see how mortal an</td></tr><tr><td>    unkindness is to them; if they suffer our departure, death's the</td></tr><tr><td>    word.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. I must be gone.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Under a compelling occasion, let women die. It were pity</td></tr><tr><td>    to cast them away for nothing, though between them and a great</td></tr><tr><td>    cause they should be esteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching but</td></tr><tr><td>    the least noise of this, dies instantly; I have seen her die</td></tr><tr><td>    twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do think there is mettle</td></tr><tr><td>    in death, which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a</td></tr><tr><td>    celerity in dying.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. She is cunning past man's thought.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Alack, sir, no! Her passions are made of nothing but the</td></tr><tr><td>    finest part of pure love. We cannot call her winds and waters</td></tr><tr><td>    sighs and tears; they are greater storms and tempests than</td></tr><tr><td>    almanacs can report. This cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she</td></tr><tr><td>    makes a show'r of rain as well as Jove.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Would I had never seen her!</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. O Sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of</td></tr><tr><td>    work, which not to have been blest withal would have discredited</td></tr><tr><td>    your travel.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Fulvia is dead.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Sir?</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Fulvia is dead.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Fulvia?</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Dead.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it</td></tr><tr><td>    pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it</td></tr><tr><td>    shows to man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein that</td></tr><tr><td>    when old robes are worn out there are members to make new. If</td></tr><tr><td>    there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,</td></tr><tr><td>    and the case to be lamented. This grief is crown'd with</td></tr><tr><td>    consolation: your old smock brings forth a new petticoat; and</td></tr><tr><td>    indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. The business she hath broached in the state</td></tr><tr><td>    Cannot endure my absence.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. And the business you have broach'd here cannot be</td></tr><tr><td>    without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which wholly depends</td></tr><tr><td>    on your abode.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. No more light answers. Let our officers</td></tr><tr><td>    Have notice what we purpose. I shall break</td></tr><tr><td>    The cause of our expedience to the Queen,</td></tr><tr><td>    And get her leave to part. For not alone</td></tr><tr><td>    The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,</td></tr><tr><td>    Do strongly speak to us; but the letters to</td></tr><tr><td>    Of many our contriving friends in Rome</td></tr><tr><td>    Petition us at home. Sextus Pompeius</td></tr><tr><td>    Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands</td></tr><tr><td>    The empire of the sea; our slippery people,</td></tr><tr><td>    Whose love is never link'd to the deserver</td></tr><tr><td>    Till his deserts are past, begin to throw</td></tr><tr><td>    Pompey the Great and all his dignities</td></tr><tr><td>    Upon his son; who, high in name and power,</td></tr><tr><td>    Higher than both in blood and life, stands up</td></tr><tr><td>    For the main soldier; whose quality, going on,</td></tr><tr><td>    The sides o' th' world may danger. Much is breeding</td></tr><tr><td>    Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life</td></tr><tr><td>    And not a serpent's poison. Say our pleasure,</td></tr><tr><td>    To such whose place is under us, requires</td></tr><tr><td>    Our quick remove from hence.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. I shall do't.                                Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>SCENE III.</td></tr><tr><td>Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Where is he?</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. I did not see him since.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. See where he is, who's with him, what he does.</td></tr><tr><td>    I did not send you. If you find him sad,</td></tr><tr><td>    Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report</td></tr><tr><td>    That I am sudden sick. Quick, and return.        Exit ALEXAS</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,</td></tr><tr><td>    You do not hold the method to enforce</td></tr><tr><td>    The like from him.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. What should I do I do not?</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. In each thing give him way; cross him in nothing.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Thou teachest like a fool- the way to lose him.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear;</td></tr><tr><td>    In time we hate that which we often fear.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                            Enter ANTONY</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>    But here comes Antony.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. I am sick and sullen.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose-</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall.</td></tr><tr><td>    It cannot be thus long; the sides of nature</td></tr><tr><td>    Will not sustain it.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Now, my dearest queen-</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Pray you, stand farther from me.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. What's the matter?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. I know by that same eye there's some good news.</td></tr><tr><td>    What says the married woman? You may go.</td></tr><tr><td>    Would she had never given you leave to come!</td></tr><tr><td>    Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here-</td></tr><tr><td>    I have no power upon you; hers you are.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. The gods best know-</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. O, never was there queen</td></tr><tr><td>    So mightily betray'd! Yet at the first</td></tr><tr><td>    I saw the treasons planted.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Cleopatra-</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Why should I think you can be mine and true,</td></tr><tr><td>    Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,</td></tr><tr><td>    Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,</td></tr><tr><td>    To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which break themselves in swearing!</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Most sweet queen-</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Nay, pray you seek no colour for your going,</td></tr><tr><td>    But bid farewell, and go. When you sued staying,</td></tr><tr><td>    Then was the time for words. No going then!</td></tr><tr><td>    Eternity was in our lips and eyes,</td></tr><tr><td>    Bliss in our brows' bent, none our parts so poor</td></tr><tr><td>    But was a race of heaven. They are so still,</td></tr><tr><td>    Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,</td></tr><tr><td>    Art turn'd the greatest liar.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. How now, lady!</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. I would I had thy inches. Thou shouldst know</td></tr><tr><td>    There were a heart in Egypt.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Hear me, queen:</td></tr><tr><td>    The strong necessity of time commands</td></tr><tr><td>    Our services awhile; but my full heart</td></tr><tr><td>    Remains in use with you. Our Italy</td></tr><tr><td>    Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius</td></tr><tr><td>    Makes his approaches to the port of Rome;</td></tr><tr><td>    Equality of two domestic powers</td></tr><tr><td>    Breed scrupulous faction; the hated, grown to strength,</td></tr><tr><td>    Are newly grown to love. The condemn'd Pompey,</td></tr><tr><td>    Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace</td></tr><tr><td>    Into the hearts of such as have not thrived</td></tr><tr><td>    Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;</td></tr><tr><td>    And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge</td></tr><tr><td>    By any desperate change. My more particular,</td></tr><tr><td>    And that which most with you should safe my going,</td></tr><tr><td>    Is Fulvia's death.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Though age from folly could not give me freedom,</td></tr><tr><td>     It does from childishness. Can Fulvia die?</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. She's dead, my Queen.</td></tr><tr><td>    Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read</td></tr><tr><td>    The garboils she awak'd. At the last, best.</td></tr><tr><td>    See when and where she died.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. O most false love!</td></tr><tr><td>    Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill</td></tr><tr><td>    With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,</td></tr><tr><td>    In Fulvia's death how mine receiv'd shall be.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Quarrel no more, but be prepar'd to know</td></tr><tr><td>    The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,</td></tr><tr><td>    As you shall give th' advice. By the fire</td></tr><tr><td>    That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence</td></tr><tr><td>    Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war</td></tr><tr><td>    As thou affects.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Cut my lace, Charmian, come!</td></tr><tr><td>    But let it be; I am quickly ill and well-</td></tr><tr><td>    So Antony loves.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. My precious queen, forbear,</td></tr><tr><td>    And give true evidence to his love, which stands</td></tr><tr><td>    An honourable trial.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. So Fulvia told me.</td></tr><tr><td>    I prithee turn aside and weep for her;</td></tr><tr><td>    Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears</td></tr><tr><td>    Belong to Egypt. Good now, play one scene</td></tr><tr><td>    Of excellent dissembling, and let it look</td></tr><tr><td>    Like perfect honour.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. You'll heat my blood; no more.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. You can do better yet; but this is meetly.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Now, by my sword-</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. And target. Still he mends;</td></tr><tr><td>    But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,</td></tr><tr><td>    How this Herculean Roman does become</td></tr><tr><td>    The carriage of his chafe.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. I'll leave you, lady.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Courteous lord, one word.</td></tr><tr><td>    Sir, you and I must part- but that's not it.</td></tr><tr><td>    Sir, you and I have lov'd- but there's not it.</td></tr><tr><td>    That you know well. Something it is I would-</td></tr><tr><td>    O, my oblivion is a very Antony,</td></tr><tr><td>    And I am all forgotten!</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. But that your royalty</td></tr><tr><td>    Holds idleness your subject, I should take you</td></tr><tr><td>    For idleness itself.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. 'Tis sweating labour</td></tr><tr><td>    To bear such idleness so near the heart</td></tr><tr><td>    As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;</td></tr><tr><td>    Since my becomings kill me when they do not</td></tr><tr><td>    Eye well to you. Your honour calls you hence;</td></tr><tr><td>    Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly,</td></tr><tr><td>    And all the gods go with you! Upon your sword</td></tr><tr><td>    Sit laurel victory, and smooth success</td></tr><tr><td>    Be strew'd before your feet!</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Let us go. Come.</td></tr><tr><td>    Our separation so abides and flies</td></tr><tr><td>    That thou, residing here, goes yet with me,</td></tr><tr><td>    And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee.</td></tr><tr><td>    Away!                                                 Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>SCENE IV.</td></tr><tr><td>Rome. CAESAR'S house</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, reading a letter; LEPIDUS, and their train</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,</td></tr><tr><td>    It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate</td></tr><tr><td>    Our great competitor. From Alexandria</td></tr><tr><td>    This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes</td></tr><tr><td>    The lamps of night in revel; is not more manlike</td></tr><tr><td>    Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy</td></tr><tr><td>    More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or</td></tr><tr><td>    Vouchsaf'd to think he had partners. You shall find there</td></tr><tr><td>    A man who is the abstract of all faults</td></tr><tr><td>    That all men follow.</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. I must not think there are</td></tr><tr><td>    Evils enow to darken all his goodness.</td></tr><tr><td>    His faults, in him, seem as the spots of heaven,</td></tr><tr><td>    More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary</td></tr><tr><td>    Rather than purchas'd; what he cannot change</td></tr><tr><td>    Than what he chooses.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. You are too indulgent. Let's grant it is not</td></tr><tr><td>    Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,</td></tr><tr><td>    To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit</td></tr><tr><td>    And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,</td></tr><tr><td>    To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet</td></tr><tr><td>    With knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him-</td></tr><tr><td>    As his composure must be rare indeed</td></tr><tr><td>    Whom these things cannot blemish- yet must Antony</td></tr><tr><td>    No way excuse his foils when we do bear</td></tr><tr><td>    So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd</td></tr><tr><td>    His vacancy with his voluptuousness,</td></tr><tr><td>    Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones</td></tr><tr><td>    Call on him for't! But to confound such time</td></tr><tr><td>    That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud</td></tr><tr><td>    As his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid</td></tr><tr><td>    As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,</td></tr><tr><td>    Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,</td></tr><tr><td>    And so rebel to judgment.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                   Enter a MESSENGER</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. Here's more news.</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,</td></tr><tr><td>    Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report</td></tr><tr><td>    How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,</td></tr><tr><td>    And it appears he is belov'd of those</td></tr><tr><td>    That only have fear'd Caesar. To the ports</td></tr><tr><td>    The discontents repair, and men's reports</td></tr><tr><td>    Give him much wrong'd.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. I should have known no less.</td></tr><tr><td>    It hath been taught us from the primal state</td></tr><tr><td>    That he which is was wish'd until he were;</td></tr><tr><td>    And the ebb'd man, ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love,</td></tr><tr><td>    Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,</td></tr><tr><td>    Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,</td></tr><tr><td>    Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,</td></tr><tr><td>    To rot itself with motion.</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. Caesar, I bring thee word</td></tr><tr><td>    Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,</td></tr><tr><td>    Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound</td></tr><tr><td>    With keels of every kind. Many hot inroads</td></tr><tr><td>    They make in Italy; the borders maritime</td></tr><tr><td>    Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt.</td></tr><tr><td>    No vessel can peep forth but 'tis as soon</td></tr><tr><td>    Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more</td></tr><tr><td>    Than could his war resisted.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Antony,</td></tr><tr><td>    Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once</td></tr><tr><td>    Was beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st</td></tr><tr><td>    Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel</td></tr><tr><td>    Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,</td></tr><tr><td>    Though daintily brought up, with patience more</td></tr><tr><td>    Than savages could suffer. Thou didst drink</td></tr><tr><td>    The stale of horses and the gilded puddle</td></tr><tr><td>    Which beasts would cough at. Thy palate then did deign</td></tr><tr><td>    The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;</td></tr><tr><td>    Yea, like the stag when snow the pasture sheets,</td></tr><tr><td>    The barks of trees thou brows'd. On the Alps</td></tr><tr><td>    It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which some did die to look on. And all this-</td></tr><tr><td>    It wounds thine honour that I speak it now-</td></tr><tr><td>    Was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek</td></tr><tr><td>    So much as lank'd not.</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. 'Tis pity of him.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Let his shames quickly</td></tr><tr><td>    Drive him to Rome. 'Tis time we twain</td></tr><tr><td>    Did show ourselves i' th' field; and to that end</td></tr><tr><td>    Assemble we immediate council. Pompey</td></tr><tr><td>    Thrives in our idleness.</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. To-morrow, Caesar,</td></tr><tr><td>    I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly</td></tr><tr><td>    Both what by sea and land I can be able</td></tr><tr><td>    To front this present time.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Till which encounter</td></tr><tr><td>    It is my business too. Farewell.</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. Farewell, my lord. What you shall know meantime</td></tr><tr><td>    Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,</td></tr><tr><td>    To let me be partaker.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Doubt not, sir;</td></tr><tr><td>    I knew it for my bond.                                Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>SCENE V.</td></tr><tr><td>Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Charmian!</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Madam?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Ha, ha!</td></tr><tr><td>    Give me to drink mandragora.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Why, madam?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. That I might sleep out this great gap of time</td></tr><tr><td>    My Antony is away.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. You think of him too much.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. O, 'tis treason!</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Madam, I trust, not so.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Thou, eunuch Mardian!</td></tr><tr><td>  MARDIAN. What's your Highness' pleasure?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure</td></tr><tr><td>    In aught an eunuch has. 'Tis well for thee</td></tr><tr><td>    That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts</td></tr><tr><td>    May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?</td></tr><tr><td>  MARDIAN. Yes, gracious madam.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Indeed?</td></tr><tr><td>  MARDIAN. Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing</td></tr><tr><td>    But what indeed is honest to be done.</td></tr><tr><td>    Yet have I fierce affections, and think</td></tr><tr><td>    What Venus did with Mars.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. O Charmian,</td></tr><tr><td>    Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he or sits he?</td></tr><tr><td>    Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?</td></tr><tr><td>    O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!</td></tr><tr><td>    Do bravely, horse; for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?</td></tr><tr><td>    The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm</td></tr><tr><td>    And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,</td></tr><tr><td>    Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'</td></tr><tr><td>    For so he calls me. Now I feed myself</td></tr><tr><td>    With most delicious poison. Think on me,</td></tr><tr><td>    That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,</td></tr><tr><td>    And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,</td></tr><tr><td>    When thou wast here above the ground, I was</td></tr><tr><td>    A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey</td></tr><tr><td>    Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;</td></tr><tr><td>    There would he anchor his aspect and die</td></tr><tr><td>    With looking on his life.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                         Enter ALEXAS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  ALEXAS. Sovereign of Egypt, hail!</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!</td></tr><tr><td>    Yet, coming from him, that great med'cine hath</td></tr><tr><td>    With his tinct gilded thee.</td></tr><tr><td>    How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?</td></tr><tr><td>  ALEXAS. Last thing he did, dear Queen,</td></tr><tr><td>    He kiss'd- the last of many doubled kisses-</td></tr><tr><td>    This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Mine ear must pluck it thence.</td></tr><tr><td>  ALEXAS. 'Good friend,' quoth he</td></tr><tr><td>    'Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends</td></tr><tr><td>    This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,</td></tr><tr><td>    To mend the petty present, I will piece</td></tr><tr><td>    Her opulent throne with kingdoms. All the East,</td></tr><tr><td>    Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,</td></tr><tr><td>    And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,</td></tr><tr><td>    Who neigh'd so high that what I would have spoke</td></tr><tr><td>    Was beastly dumb'd by him.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. What, was he sad or merry?</td></tr><tr><td>  ALEXAS. Like to the time o' th' year between the extremes</td></tr><tr><td>    Of hot and cold; he was nor sad nor merry.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. O well-divided disposition! Note him,</td></tr><tr><td>    Note him, good Charmian; 'tis the man; but note him!</td></tr><tr><td>    He was not sad, for he would shine on those</td></tr><tr><td>    That make their looks by his; he was not merry,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay</td></tr><tr><td>    In Egypt with his joy; but between both.</td></tr><tr><td>    O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,</td></tr><tr><td>    The violence of either thee becomes,</td></tr><tr><td>    So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?</td></tr><tr><td>  ALEXAS. Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.</td></tr><tr><td>    Why do you send so thick?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Who's born that day</td></tr><tr><td>    When I forget to send to Antony</td></tr><tr><td>    Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.</td></tr><tr><td>    Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,</td></tr><tr><td>    Ever love Caesar so?</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. O that brave Caesar!</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Be chok'd with such another emphasis!</td></tr><tr><td>    Say 'the brave Antony.'</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. The valiant Caesar!</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth</td></tr><tr><td>    If thou with Caesar paragon again</td></tr><tr><td>    My man of men.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. By your most gracious pardon,</td></tr><tr><td>    I sing but after you.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. My salad days,</td></tr><tr><td>    When I was green in judgment, cold in blood,</td></tr><tr><td>    To say as I said then. But come, away!</td></tr><tr><td>    Get me ink and paper.</td></tr><tr><td>    He shall have every day a several greeting,</td></tr><tr><td>    Or I'll unpeople Egypt.

SCENE I.</td></tr><tr><td>Messina. POMPEY'S house</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Enter POMPEY, MENECRATES, and MENAS, in warlike manner</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. If the great gods be just, they shall assist</td></tr><tr><td>    The deeds of justest men.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENECRATES. Know, worthy Pompey,</td></tr><tr><td>    That what they do delay they not deny.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays</td></tr><tr><td>    The thing we sue for.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENECRATES. We, ignorant of ourselves,</td></tr><tr><td>    Beg often our own harms, which the wise pow'rs</td></tr><tr><td>    Deny us for our good; so find we profit</td></tr><tr><td>    By losing of our prayers.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. I shall do well.</td></tr><tr><td>    The people love me, and the sea is mine;</td></tr><tr><td>    My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope</td></tr><tr><td>    Says it will come to th' full. Mark Antony</td></tr><tr><td>    In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make</td></tr><tr><td>    No wars without doors. Caesar gets money where</td></tr><tr><td>    He loses hearts. Lepidus flatters both,</td></tr><tr><td>    Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,</td></tr><tr><td>    Nor either cares for him.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. Caesar and Lepidus</td></tr><tr><td>    Are in the field. A mighty strength they carry.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. Where have you this? 'Tis false.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. From Silvius, sir.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,</td></tr><tr><td>    Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,</td></tr><tr><td>    Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wan'd lip!</td></tr><tr><td>    Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both;</td></tr><tr><td>    Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,</td></tr><tr><td>    Keep his brain fuming. Epicurean cooks</td></tr><tr><td>    Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,</td></tr><tr><td>    That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour</td></tr><tr><td>    Even till a Lethe'd dullness-</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                       Enter VARRIUS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>    How now, Varrius!</td></tr><tr><td>  VARRIUS. This is most certain that I shall deliver:</td></tr><tr><td>    Mark Antony is every hour in Rome</td></tr><tr><td>    Expected. Since he went from Egypt 'tis</td></tr><tr><td>    A space for farther travel.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. I could have given less matter</td></tr><tr><td>    A better ear. Menas, I did not think</td></tr><tr><td>    This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm</td></tr><tr><td>    For such a petty war; his soldiership</td></tr><tr><td>    Is twice the other twain. But let us rear</td></tr><tr><td>    The higher our opinion, that our stirring</td></tr><tr><td>    Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck</td></tr><tr><td>    The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. I cannot hope</td></tr><tr><td>    Caesar and Antony shall well greet together.</td></tr><tr><td>    His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;</td></tr><tr><td>    His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,</td></tr><tr><td>    Not mov'd by Antony.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. I know not, Menas,</td></tr><tr><td>    How lesser enmities may give way to greater.</td></tr><tr><td>    Were't not that we stand up against them all,</td></tr><tr><td>    'Twere pregnant they should square between themselves;</td></tr><tr><td>    For they have entertained cause enough</td></tr><tr><td>    To draw their swords. But how the fear of us</td></tr><tr><td>    May cement their divisions, and bind up</td></tr><tr><td>    The petty difference we yet not know.</td></tr><tr><td>    Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands</td></tr><tr><td>    Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.</td></tr><tr><td>    Come, Menas.                                          Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>SCENE II.</td></tr><tr><td>Rome. The house of LEPIDUS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Enter ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,</td></tr><tr><td>    And shall become you well, to entreat your captain</td></tr><tr><td>    To soft and gentle speech.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. I shall entreat him</td></tr><tr><td>    To answer like himself. If Caesar move him,</td></tr><tr><td>    Let Antony look over Caesar's head</td></tr><tr><td>    And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,</td></tr><tr><td>    Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,</td></tr><tr><td>    I would not shave't to-day.</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. 'Tis not a time</td></tr><tr><td>    For private stomaching.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Every time</td></tr><tr><td>    Serves for the matter that is then born in't.</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. But small to greater matters must give way.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Not if the small come first.</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. Your speech is passion;</td></tr><tr><td>    But pray you stir no embers up. Here comes</td></tr><tr><td>    The noble Antony.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                Enter ANTONY and VENTIDIUS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. And yonder, Caesar.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>            Enter CAESAR, MAECENAS, and AGRIPPA</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. If we compose well here, to Parthia.</td></tr><tr><td>    Hark, Ventidius.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. I do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa.</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. Noble friends,</td></tr><tr><td>    That which combin'd us was most great, and let not</td></tr><tr><td>    A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,</td></tr><tr><td>    May it be gently heard. When we debate</td></tr><tr><td>    Our trivial difference loud, we do commit</td></tr><tr><td>    Murder in healing wounds. Then, noble partners,</td></tr><tr><td>    The rather for I earnestly beseech,</td></tr><tr><td>    Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,</td></tr><tr><td>    Nor curstness grow to th' matter.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. 'Tis spoken well.</td></tr><tr><td>    Were we before our arinies, and to fight,</td></tr><tr><td>    I should do thus.                                 [Flourish]</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Welcome to Rome.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Thank you.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Sit.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Sit, sir.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Nay, then.                                  [They sit]</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. I learn you take things ill which are not so,</td></tr><tr><td>    Or being, concern you not.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. I must be laugh'd at</td></tr><tr><td>    If, or for nothing or a little,</td></tr><tr><td>    Should say myself offended, and with you</td></tr><tr><td>    Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at that I should</td></tr><tr><td>    Once name you derogately when to sound your name</td></tr><tr><td>    It not concern'd me.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. My being in Egypt, Caesar,</td></tr><tr><td>    What was't to you?</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. No more than my residing here at Rome</td></tr><tr><td>    Might be to you in Egypt. Yet, if you there</td></tr><tr><td>    Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt</td></tr><tr><td>    Might be my question.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. How intend you- practis'd?</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. You may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent</td></tr><tr><td>    By what did here befall me. Your wife and brother</td></tr><tr><td>    Made wars upon me, and their contestation</td></tr><tr><td>    Was theme for you; you were the word of war.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. You do mistake your business; my brother never</td></tr><tr><td>    Did urge me in his act. I did inquire it,</td></tr><tr><td>    And have my learning from some true reports</td></tr><tr><td>    That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather</td></tr><tr><td>    Discredit my authority with yours,</td></tr><tr><td>    And make the wars alike against my stomach,</td></tr><tr><td>    Having alike your cause? Of this my letters</td></tr><tr><td>    Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,</td></tr><tr><td>    As matter whole you have not to make it with,</td></tr><tr><td>    It must not be with this.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. You praise yourself</td></tr><tr><td>    By laying defects of judgment to me; but</td></tr><tr><td>    You patch'd up your excuses.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Not so, not so;</td></tr><tr><td>    I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,</td></tr><tr><td>    Very necessity of this thought, that I,</td></tr><tr><td>    Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,</td></tr><tr><td>    Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars</td></tr><tr><td>    Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,</td></tr><tr><td>    I would you had her spirit in such another!</td></tr><tr><td>    The third o' th' world is yours, which with a snaffle</td></tr><tr><td>    You may pace easy, but not such a wife.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to</td></tr><tr><td>    wars with the women!</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,</td></tr><tr><td>    Made out of her impatience- which not wanted</td></tr><tr><td>    Shrewdness of policy too- I grieving grant</td></tr><tr><td>    Did you too much disquiet. For that you must</td></tr><tr><td>    But say I could not help it.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. I wrote to you</td></tr><tr><td>    When rioting in Alexandria; you</td></tr><tr><td>    Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts</td></tr><tr><td>    Did gibe my missive out of audience.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Sir,</td></tr><tr><td>    He fell upon me ere admitted. Then</td></tr><tr><td>    Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want</td></tr><tr><td>    Of what I was i' th' morning; but next day</td></tr><tr><td>    I told him of myself, which was as much</td></tr><tr><td>    As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow</td></tr><tr><td>    Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,</td></tr><tr><td>    Out of our question wipe him.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. You have broken</td></tr><tr><td>    The article of your oath, which you shall never</td></tr><tr><td>    Have tongue to charge me with.</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. Soft, Caesar!</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. No;</td></tr><tr><td>    Lepidus, let him speak.</td></tr><tr><td>    The honour is sacred which he talks on now,</td></tr><tr><td>    Supposing that I lack'd it. But on, Caesar:</td></tr><tr><td>    The article of my oath-</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. To lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them,</td></tr><tr><td>    The which you both denied.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Neglected, rather;</td></tr><tr><td>    And then when poisoned hours had bound me up</td></tr><tr><td>    From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,</td></tr><tr><td>    I'll play the penitent to you; but mine honesty</td></tr><tr><td>    Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power</td></tr><tr><td>    Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,</td></tr><tr><td>    To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;</td></tr><tr><td>    For which myself, the ignorant motive, do</td></tr><tr><td>    So far ask pardon as befits mine honour</td></tr><tr><td>    To stoop in such a case.</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. 'Tis noble spoken.</td></tr><tr><td>  MAECENAS. If it might please you to enforce no further</td></tr><tr><td>    The griefs between ye- to forget them quite</td></tr><tr><td>    Were to remember that the present need</td></tr><tr><td>    Speaks to atone you.</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. Worthily spoken, Maecenas.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Or, if you borrow one another's love for the instant,</td></tr><tr><td>    you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again.</td></tr><tr><td>    You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to</td></tr><tr><td>    do.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Go to, then- your considerate stone!</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. I do not much dislike the matter, but</td></tr><tr><td>    The manner of his speech; for't cannot be</td></tr><tr><td>    We shall remain in friendship, our conditions</td></tr><tr><td>    So diff'ring in their acts. Yet if I knew</td></tr><tr><td>    What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge</td></tr><tr><td>    O' th' world, I would pursue it.</td></tr><tr><td>  AGRIPPA. Give me leave, Caesar.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Speak, Agrippa.</td></tr><tr><td>  AGRIPPA. Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,</td></tr><tr><td>    Admir'd Octavia. Great Mark Antony</td></tr><tr><td>    Is now a widower.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Say not so, Agrippa.</td></tr><tr><td>    If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof</td></tr><tr><td>    Were well deserv'd of rashness.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear</td></tr><tr><td>    Agrippa further speak.</td></tr><tr><td>  AGRIPPA. To hold you in perpetual amity,</td></tr><tr><td>    To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts</td></tr><tr><td>    With an unslipping knot, take Antony</td></tr><tr><td>    Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims</td></tr><tr><td>    No worse a husband than the best of men;</td></tr><tr><td>    Whose virtue and whose general graces speak</td></tr><tr><td>    That which none else can utter. By this marriage</td></tr><tr><td>    All little jealousies, which now seem great,</td></tr><tr><td>    And all great fears, which now import their dangers,</td></tr><tr><td>    Would then be nothing. Truths would be tales,</td></tr><tr><td>    Where now half tales be truths. Her love to both</td></tr><tr><td>    Would each to other, and all loves to both,</td></tr><tr><td>    Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;</td></tr><tr><td>    For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,</td></tr><tr><td>    By duty ruminated.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Will Caesar speak?</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd</td></tr><tr><td>    With what is spoke already.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. What power is in Agrippa,</td></tr><tr><td>    If I would say 'Agrippa, be it so,'</td></tr><tr><td>    To make this good?</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. The power of Caesar, and</td></tr><tr><td>    His power unto Octavia.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. May I never</td></tr><tr><td>    To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,</td></tr><tr><td>    Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand.</td></tr><tr><td>    Further this act of grace; and from this hour</td></tr><tr><td>    The heart of brothers govern in our loves</td></tr><tr><td>    And sway our great designs!</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. There is my hand.</td></tr><tr><td>    A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother</td></tr><tr><td>    Did ever love so dearly. Let her live</td></tr><tr><td>    To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never</td></tr><tr><td>    Fly off our loves again!</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. Happily, amen!</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;</td></tr><tr><td>    For he hath laid strange courtesies and great</td></tr><tr><td>    Of late upon me. I must thank him only,</td></tr><tr><td>    Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;</td></tr><tr><td>    At heel of that, defy him.</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. Time calls upon's.</td></tr><tr><td>    Of us must Pompey presently be sought,</td></tr><tr><td>    Or else he seeks out us.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Where lies he?</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. About the Mount Misenum.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. What is his strength by land?</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Great and increasing; but by sea</td></tr><tr><td>    He is an absolute master.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. So is the fame.</td></tr><tr><td>    Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it.</td></tr><tr><td>    Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we</td></tr><tr><td>    The business we have talk'd of.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. With most gladness;</td></tr><tr><td>    And do invite you to my sister's view,</td></tr><tr><td>    Whither straight I'll lead you.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Let us, Lepidus,</td></tr><tr><td>    Not lack your company.</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. Noble Antony,</td></tr><tr><td>    Not sickness should detain me.                    [Flourish]</td></tr><tr><td>                     Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS, AGRIPPA, MAECENAS</td></tr><tr><td>  MAECENAS. Welcome from Egypt, sir.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Maecenas! My honourable</td></tr><tr><td>    friend, Agrippa!</td></tr><tr><td>  AGRIPPA. Good Enobarbus!</td></tr><tr><td>  MAECENAS. We have cause to be glad that matters are so well</td></tr><tr><td>    digested. You stay'd well by't in Egypt.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made</td></tr><tr><td>    the night light with drinking.</td></tr><tr><td>  MAECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but</td></tr><tr><td>    twelve persons there. Is this true?</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more</td></tr><tr><td>    monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.</td></tr><tr><td>  MAECENAS. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart,</td></tr><tr><td>    upon the river of Cydnus.</td></tr><tr><td>  AGRIPPA. There she appear'd indeed! Or my reporter devis'd well for</td></tr><tr><td>    her.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. I will tell you.</td></tr><tr><td>    The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,</td></tr><tr><td>    Burn'd on the water. The poop was beaten gold;</td></tr><tr><td>    Purple the sails, and so perfumed that</td></tr><tr><td>    The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made</td></tr><tr><td>    The water which they beat to follow faster,</td></tr><tr><td>    As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,</td></tr><tr><td>    It beggar'd all description. She did lie</td></tr><tr><td>    In her pavilion, cloth-of-gold, of tissue,</td></tr><tr><td>    O'erpicturing that Venus where we see</td></tr><tr><td>    The fancy out-work nature. On each side her</td></tr><tr><td>    Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,</td></tr><tr><td>    With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem</td></tr><tr><td>    To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,</td></tr><tr><td>    And what they undid did.</td></tr><tr><td>  AGRIPPA. O, rare for Antony!</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,</td></tr><tr><td>    So many mermaids, tended her i' th' eyes,</td></tr><tr><td>    And made their bends adornings. At the helm</td></tr><tr><td>    A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle</td></tr><tr><td>    Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands</td></tr><tr><td>    That yarely frame the office. From the barge</td></tr><tr><td>    A strange invisible perfume hits the sense</td></tr><tr><td>    Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast</td></tr><tr><td>    Her people out upon her; and Antony,</td></tr><tr><td>    Enthron'd i' th' market-place, did sit alone,</td></tr><tr><td>    Whistling to th' air; which, but for vacancy,</td></tr><tr><td>    Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,</td></tr><tr><td>    And made a gap in nature.</td></tr><tr><td>  AGRIPPA. Rare Egyptian!</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,</td></tr><tr><td>    Invited her to supper. She replied</td></tr><tr><td>    It should be better he became her guest;</td></tr><tr><td>    Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony,</td></tr><tr><td>    Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,</td></tr><tr><td>    Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,</td></tr><tr><td>    And for his ordinary pays his heart</td></tr><tr><td>    For what his eyes eat only.</td></tr><tr><td>  AGRIPPA. Royal wench!</td></tr><tr><td>    She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed.</td></tr><tr><td>    He ploughed her, and she cropp'd.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. I saw her once</td></tr><tr><td>    Hop forty paces through the public street;</td></tr><tr><td>    And, having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,</td></tr><tr><td>    That she did make defect perfection,</td></tr><tr><td>    And, breathless, pow'r breathe forth.</td></tr><tr><td>  MAECENAS. Now Antony must leave her utterly.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Never! He will not.</td></tr><tr><td>    Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale</td></tr><tr><td>    Her infinite variety. Other women cloy</td></tr><tr><td>    The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry</td></tr><tr><td>    Where most she satisfies; for vilest things</td></tr><tr><td>    Become themselves in her, that the holy priests</td></tr><tr><td>    Bless her when she is riggish.</td></tr><tr><td>  MAECENAS. If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle</td></tr><tr><td>    The heart of Antony, Octavia is</td></tr><tr><td>    A blessed lottery to him.</td></tr><tr><td>  AGRIPPA. Let us go.</td></tr><tr><td>    Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest</td></tr><tr><td>    Whilst you abide here.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Humbly, sir, I thank you.                    Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>SCENE III.</td></tr><tr><td>Rome. CAESAR'S house</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Enter ANTONY, CAESAR, OCTAVIA between them</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. The world and my great office will sometimes</td></tr><tr><td>    Divide me from your bosom.</td></tr><tr><td>  OCTAVIA. All which time</td></tr><tr><td>    Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers</td></tr><tr><td>    To them for you.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Good night, sir. My Octavia,</td></tr><tr><td>    Read not my blemishes in the world's report.</td></tr><tr><td>    I have not kept my square; but that to come</td></tr><tr><td>    Shall all be done by th' rule. Good night, dear lady.</td></tr><tr><td>  OCTAVIA. Good night, sir.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Good night.                  Exeunt CAESAR and OCTAVIA</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                        Enter SOOTHSAYER</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt?</td></tr><tr><td>  SOOTHSAYER. Would I had never come from thence, nor you thither!</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. If you can- your reason.</td></tr><tr><td>  SOOTHSAYER. I see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue; but</td></tr><tr><td>    yet hie you to Egypt again.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Say to me,</td></tr><tr><td>    Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine?</td></tr><tr><td>  SOOTHSAYER. Caesar's.</td></tr><tr><td>    Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side.</td></tr><tr><td>    Thy daemon, that thy spirit which keeps thee, is</td></tr><tr><td>    Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable,</td></tr><tr><td>    Where Caesar's is not; but near him thy angel</td></tr><tr><td>    Becomes a fear, as being o'erpow'r'd. Therefore</td></tr><tr><td>    Make space enough between you.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Speak this no more.</td></tr><tr><td>  SOOTHSAYER. To none but thee; no more but when to thee.</td></tr><tr><td>    If thou dost play with him at any game,</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou art sure to lose; and of that natural luck</td></tr><tr><td>    He beats thee 'gainst the odds. Thy lustre thickens</td></tr><tr><td>    When he shines by. I say again, thy spirit</td></tr><tr><td>    Is all afraid to govern thee near him;</td></tr><tr><td>    But, he away, 'tis noble.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Get thee gone.</td></tr><tr><td>    Say to Ventidius I would speak with him.</td></tr><tr><td>                                                 Exit SOOTHSAYER</td></tr><tr><td>    He shall to Parthia.- Be it art or hap,</td></tr><tr><td>    He hath spoken true. The very dice obey him;</td></tr><tr><td>    And in our sports my better cunning faints</td></tr><tr><td>    Under his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds;</td></tr><tr><td>    His cocks do win the battle still of mine,</td></tr><tr><td>    When it is all to nought, and his quails ever</td></tr><tr><td>    Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt;</td></tr><tr><td>    And though I make this marriage for my peace,</td></tr><tr><td>    I' th' East my pleasure lies.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                       Enter VENTIDIUS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>    O, come, Ventidius,</td></tr><tr><td>    You must to Parthia. Your commission's ready;</td></tr><tr><td>    Follow me and receive't.                              Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>SCENE IV.</td></tr><tr><td>Rome. A street</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Enter LEPIDUS, MAECENAS, and AGRIPPA</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. Trouble yourselves no further. Pray you hasten</td></tr><tr><td>    Your generals after.</td></tr><tr><td>  AGRIPPA. Sir, Mark Antony</td></tr><tr><td>    Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow.</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which will become you both, farewell.</td></tr><tr><td>  MAECENAS. We shall,</td></tr><tr><td>    As I conceive the journey, be at th' Mount</td></tr><tr><td>    Before you, Lepidus.</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. Your way is shorter;</td></tr><tr><td>    My purposes do draw me much about.</td></tr><tr><td>    You'll win two days upon me.</td></tr><tr><td>  BOTH. Sir, good success!</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. Farewell.                                      Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>SCENE V.</td></tr><tr><td>Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Give me some music- music, moody food</td></tr><tr><td>    Of us that trade in love.</td></tr><tr><td>  ALL. The music, ho!</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                    Enter MARDIAN the eunuch</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Let it alone! Let's to billiards. Come, Charmian.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. As well a woman with an eunuch play'd</td></tr><tr><td>    As with a woman. Come, you'll play with me, sir?</td></tr><tr><td>  MARDIAN. As well as I can, madam.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. And when good will is show'd, though't come too short,</td></tr><tr><td>    The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now.</td></tr><tr><td>    Give me mine angle- we'll to th' river. There,</td></tr><tr><td>    My music playing far off, I will betray</td></tr><tr><td>    Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce</td></tr><tr><td>    Their slimy jaws; and as I draw them up</td></tr><tr><td>    I'll think them every one an Antony,</td></tr><tr><td>    And say 'Ah ha! Y'are caught.'</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. 'Twas merry when</td></tr><tr><td>    You wager'd on your angling; when your diver</td></tr><tr><td>    Did hang a salt fish on his hook, which he</td></tr><tr><td>    With fervency drew up.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. That time? O times</td></tr><tr><td>    I laughed him out of patience; and that night</td></tr><tr><td>    I laugh'd him into patience; and next morn,</td></tr><tr><td>    Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed,</td></tr><tr><td>    Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst</td></tr><tr><td>    I wore his sword Philippan.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                    Enter a MESSENGER</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>    O! from Italy?</td></tr><tr><td>    Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,</td></tr><tr><td>    That long time have been barren.</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. Madam, madam-</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Antony's dead! If thou say so, villain,</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou kill'st thy mistress; but well and free,</td></tr><tr><td>    If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here</td></tr><tr><td>    My bluest veins to kiss- a hand that kings</td></tr><tr><td>    Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing.</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. First, madam, he is well.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Why, there's more gold.</td></tr><tr><td>    But, sirrah, mark, we use</td></tr><tr><td>    To say the dead are well. Bring it to that,</td></tr><tr><td>    The gold I give thee will I melt and pour</td></tr><tr><td>    Down thy ill-uttering throat.</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. Good madam, hear me.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Well, go to, I will.</td></tr><tr><td>    But there's no goodness in thy face. If Antony</td></tr><tr><td>    Be free and healthful- why so tart a favour</td></tr><tr><td>    To trumpet such good tidings? If not well,</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,</td></tr><tr><td>    Not like a formal man.</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. Will't please you hear me?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st.</td></tr><tr><td>    Yet, if thou say Antony lives, is well,</td></tr><tr><td>    Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,</td></tr><tr><td>    I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail</td></tr><tr><td>    Rich pearls upon thee.</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. Madam, he's well.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Well said.</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. And friends with Caesar.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Th'art an honest man.</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Make thee a fortune from me.</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. But yet, madam-</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. I do not like 'but yet.' It does allay</td></tr><tr><td>    The good precedence; fie upon 'but yet'!</td></tr><tr><td>    'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth</td></tr><tr><td>    Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,</td></tr><tr><td>    Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,</td></tr><tr><td>    The good and bad together. He's friends with Caesar;</td></tr><tr><td>    In state of health, thou say'st; and, thou say'st, free.</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. Free, madam! No; I made no such report.</td></tr><tr><td>    He's bound unto Octavia.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. For what good turn?</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. For the best turn i' th' bed.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. I am pale, Charmian.</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. Madam, he's married to Octavia.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. The most infectious pestilence upon thee!</td></tr><tr><td>                                              [Strikes him down]</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. Good madam, patience.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. What say you? Hence,                  [Strikes him]</td></tr><tr><td>    Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes</td></tr><tr><td>    Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head;</td></tr><tr><td>                                     [She hales him up and down]</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire and stew'd in brine,</td></tr><tr><td>    Smarting in ling'ring pickle.</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. Gracious madam,</td></tr><tr><td>    I that do bring the news made not the match.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,</td></tr><tr><td>    And make thy fortunes proud. The blow thou hadst</td></tr><tr><td>    Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage;</td></tr><tr><td>    And I will boot thee with what gift beside</td></tr><tr><td>    Thy modesty can beg.</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. He's married, madam.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Rogue, thou hast liv'd too long.    [Draws a knife]</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. Nay, then I'll run.</td></tr><tr><td>    What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.             Exit</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:</td></tr><tr><td>    The man is innocent.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Some innocents scape not the thunderbolt.</td></tr><tr><td>    Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures</td></tr><tr><td>    Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again.</td></tr><tr><td>    Though I am mad, I will not bite him. Call!</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. He is afear'd to come.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. I will not hurt him.</td></tr><tr><td>    These hands do lack nobility, that they strike</td></tr><tr><td>    A meaner than myself; since I myself</td></tr><tr><td>    Have given myself the cause.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                    Enter the MESSENGER again</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>    Come hither, sir.</td></tr><tr><td>    Though it be honest, it is never good</td></tr><tr><td>    To bring bad news. Give to a gracious message</td></tr><tr><td>    An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell</td></tr><tr><td>    Themselves when they be felt.</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. I have done my duty.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Is he married?</td></tr><tr><td>    I cannot hate thee worser than I do</td></tr><tr><td>    If thou again say 'Yes.'</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. He's married, madam.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. The gods confound thee! Dost thou hold there still?</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. Should I lie, madam?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. O, I would thou didst,</td></tr><tr><td>    So half my Egypt were submerg'd and made</td></tr><tr><td>    A cistern for scal'd snakes! Go, get thee hence.</td></tr><tr><td>    Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. I crave your Highness' pardon.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. He is married?</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. Take no offence that I would not offend you;</td></tr><tr><td>    To punish me for what you make me do</td></tr><tr><td>    Seems much unequal. He's married to Octavia.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. O, that his fault should make a knave of thee</td></tr><tr><td>    That art not what th'art sure of! Get thee hence.</td></tr><tr><td>    The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome</td></tr><tr><td>    Are all too dear for me.

In praising Antony I have disprais'd Caesar.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Many times, madam.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. I am paid for't now. Lead me from hence,</td></tr><tr><td>    I faint. O Iras, Charmian! 'Tis no matter.</td></tr><tr><td>    Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him</td></tr><tr><td>    Report the feature of Octavia, her years,</td></tr><tr><td>    Her inclination; let him not leave out</td></tr><tr><td>    The colour of her hair.

[To MARDIAN]</td></tr><tr><td>    Bid you Alexas</td></tr><tr><td>    Bring me word how tall she is.- Pity me, Charmian,</td></tr><tr><td>    But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.        Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>SCENE VI.</td></tr><tr><td>Near Misenum</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Flourish. Enter POMPEY and MENAS at one door, with drum and trumpet;</td></tr><tr><td>at another, CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, ENOBARBUS, MAECENAS, AGRIPPA,</td></tr><tr><td>with soldiers marching</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. Your hostages I have, so have you mine;</td></tr><tr><td>    And we shall talk before we fight.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Most meet</td></tr><tr><td>    That first we come to words; and therefore have we</td></tr><tr><td>    Our written purposes before us sent;</td></tr><tr><td>    Which if thou hast considered, let us know</td></tr><tr><td>    If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword</td></tr><tr><td>    And carry back to Sicily much tall youth</td></tr><tr><td>    That else must perish here.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. To you all three,</td></tr><tr><td>    The senators alone of this great world,</td></tr><tr><td>    Chief factors for the gods: I do not know</td></tr><tr><td>    Wherefore my father should revengers want,</td></tr><tr><td>    Having a son and friends, since Julius Caesar,</td></tr><tr><td>    Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,</td></tr><tr><td>    There saw you labouring for him. What was't</td></tr><tr><td>    That mov'd pale Cassius to conspire? and what</td></tr><tr><td>    Made the all-honour'd honest Roman, Brutus,</td></tr><tr><td>    With the arm'd rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom,</td></tr><tr><td>    To drench the Capitol, but that they would</td></tr><tr><td>    Have one man but a man? And that is it</td></tr><tr><td>    Hath made me rig my navy, at whose burden</td></tr><tr><td>    The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant</td></tr><tr><td>    To scourge th' ingratitude that despiteful Rome</td></tr><tr><td>    Cast on my noble father.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Take your time.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;</td></tr><tr><td>    We'll speak with thee at sea; at land thou know'st</td></tr><tr><td>    How much we do o'er-count thee.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. At land, indeed,</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house.</td></tr><tr><td>    But since the cuckoo builds not for himself,</td></tr><tr><td>    Remain in't as thou mayst.</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. Be pleas'd to tell us-</td></tr><tr><td>    For this is from the present- how you take</td></tr><tr><td>    The offers we have sent you.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. There's the point.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Which do not be entreated to, but weigh</td></tr><tr><td>    What it is worth embrac'd.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. And what may follow,</td></tr><tr><td>    To try a larger fortune.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. You have made me offer</td></tr><tr><td>    Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must</td></tr><tr><td>    Rid all the sea of pirates; then to send</td></tr><tr><td>    Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon,</td></tr><tr><td>    To part with unhack'd edges and bear back</td></tr><tr><td>    Our targes undinted.</td></tr><tr><td>  ALL. That's our offer.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. Know, then,</td></tr><tr><td>    I came before you here a man prepar'd</td></tr><tr><td>    To take this offer; but Mark Antony</td></tr><tr><td>    Put me to some impatience. Though I lose</td></tr><tr><td>    The praise of it by telling, you must know,</td></tr><tr><td>    When Caesar and your brother were at blows,</td></tr><tr><td>    Your mother came to Sicily and did find</td></tr><tr><td>    Her welcome friendly.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. I have heard it, Pompey,</td></tr><tr><td>    And am well studied for a liberal thanks</td></tr><tr><td>    Which I do owe you.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. Let me have your hand.</td></tr><tr><td>    I did not think, sir, to have met you here.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. The beds i' th' East are soft; and thanks to you,</td></tr><tr><td>    That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;</td></tr><tr><td>    For I have gained by't.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Since I saw you last</td></tr><tr><td>    There is a change upon you.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. Well, I know not</td></tr><tr><td>    What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;</td></tr><tr><td>    But in my bosom shall she never come</td></tr><tr><td>    To make my heart her vassal.</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. Well met here.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed.</td></tr><tr><td>    I crave our composition may be written,</td></tr><tr><td>    And seal'd between us.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. That's the next to do.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. We'll feast each other ere we part, and let's</td></tr><tr><td>    Draw lots who shall begin.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. That will I, Pompey.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. No, Antony, take the lot;</td></tr><tr><td>    But, first or last, your fine Egyptian cookery</td></tr><tr><td>    Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar</td></tr><tr><td>    Grew fat with feasting there.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. You have heard much.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. I have fair meanings, sir.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. And fair words to them.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. Then so much have I heard;</td></tr><tr><td>    And I have heard Apollodorus carried-</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. No more of that! He did so.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. What, I pray you?</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. I know thee now. How far'st thou, soldier?</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Well;</td></tr><tr><td>    And well am like to do, for I perceive</td></tr><tr><td>    Four feasts are toward.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. Let me shake thy hand.</td></tr><tr><td>    I never hated thee; I have seen thee fight,</td></tr><tr><td>    When I have envied thy behaviour.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Sir,</td></tr><tr><td>    I never lov'd you much; but I ha' prais'd ye</td></tr><tr><td>    When you have well deserv'd ten times as much</td></tr><tr><td>    As I have said you did.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. Enjoy thy plainness;</td></tr><tr><td>    It nothing ill becomes thee.</td></tr><tr><td>    Aboard my galley I invite you all.</td></tr><tr><td>    Will you lead, lords?</td></tr><tr><td>  ALL. Show's the way, sir.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. Come.               Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS and MENAS</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. [Aside] Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have made this</td></tr><tr><td>    treaty.- You and I have known, sir.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. At sea, I think.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. We have, sir.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. You have done well by water.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. And you by land.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. I Will praise any man that will praise me; though it</td></tr><tr><td>    cannot be denied what I have done by land.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. Nor what I have done by water.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you</td></tr><tr><td>    have been a great thief by sea.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. And you by land.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. There I deny my land service. But give me your hand,</td></tr><tr><td>    Menas; if our eyes had authority, here they might take two</td></tr><tr><td>    thieves kissing.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. But there is never a fair woman has a true face.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. No slander: they steal hearts.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. We came hither to fight with you.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. For my part, I am sorry it is turn'd to a drinking.</td></tr><tr><td>    Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. If he do, sure he cannot weep't back again.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. Y'have said, sir. We look'd not for Mark Antony here. Pray</td></tr><tr><td>    you, is he married to Cleopatra?</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Caesar' sister is call'd Octavia.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. Pray ye, sir?</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. 'Tis true.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not</td></tr><tr><td>    prophesy so.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage</td></tr><tr><td>    than the love of the parties.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems</td></tr><tr><td>    to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of</td></tr><tr><td>    their amity: Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. Who would not have his wife so?</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He</td></tr><tr><td>    will to his Egyptian dish again; then shall the sighs of Octavia</td></tr><tr><td>    blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is</td></tr><tr><td>    the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of</td></tr><tr><td>    their variance. Antony will use his affection where it is; he</td></tr><tr><td>    married but his occasion here.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a</td></tr><tr><td>    health for you.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. I shall take it, sir. We have us'd our throats in Egypt.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. Come, let's away.                                Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>ACT_2|SC_7</td></tr><tr><td>                           SCENE VII.</td></tr><tr><td>             On board POMPEY'S galley, off Misenum</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>     Music plays. Enter two or three SERVANTS with a banquet</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SERVANT. Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are</td></tr><tr><td>    ill-rooted already; the least wind i' th' world will blow them</td></tr><tr><td>    down.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND SERVANT. Lepidus is high-colour'd.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SERVANT. They have made him drink alms-drink.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND SERVANT. As they pinch one another by the disposition, he</td></tr><tr><td>    cries out 'No more!'; reconciles them to his entreaty and himself</td></tr><tr><td>    to th' drink.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SERVANT. But it raises the greater war between him and his</td></tr><tr><td>    discretion.</td></tr><tr><td>  SECOND SERVANT. Why, this it is to have a name in great men's</td></tr><tr><td>    fellowship. I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service</td></tr><tr><td>    as a partizan I could not heave.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SERVANT. To be call'd into a huge sphere, and not to be seen</td></tr><tr><td>    to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be, which pitifully</td></tr><tr><td>    disaster the cheeks.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>           A sennet sounded. Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS,</td></tr><tr><td>            POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MAECENAS, ENOBARBUS, MENAS,</td></tr><tr><td>                         with other CAPTAINS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. [To CAESAR] Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o' th'</td></tr><tr><td>      Nile</td></tr><tr><td>    By certain scales i' th' pyramid; they know</td></tr><tr><td>    By th' height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth</td></tr><tr><td>    Or foison follow. The higher Nilus swells</td></tr><tr><td>    The more it promises; as it ebbs, the seedsman</td></tr><tr><td>    Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,</td></tr><tr><td>    And shortly comes to harvest.</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. Y'have strange serpents there.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Ay, Lepidus.</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the</td></tr><tr><td>    operation of your sun; so is your crocodile.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. They are so.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. Sit- and some wine! A health to Lepidus!</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Not till you have slept. I fear me you'll be in till</td></tr><tr><td>    then.</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are</td></tr><tr><td>    very goodly things. Without contradiction I have heard that.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY] Pompey, a word.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. [Aside to MENAS] Say in mine ear; what is't?</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee,</td></tr><tr><td>      Captain,</td></tr><tr><td>    And hear me speak a word.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. [ Whispers in's ear ] Forbear me till anon-</td></tr><tr><td>    This wine for Lepidus!</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. What manner o' thing is your crocodile?</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. It is shap'd, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it</td></tr><tr><td>    hath breadth; it is just so high as it is, and moves with it own</td></tr><tr><td>    organs. It lives by that which nourisheth it, and the elements</td></tr><tr><td>    once out of it, it transmigrates.</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. What colour is it of?</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Of it own colour too.</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. 'Tis a strange serpent.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. 'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Will this description satisfy him?</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a very</td></tr><tr><td>    epicure.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. [Aside to MENAS] Go, hang, sir, hang! Tell me of that!</td></tr><tr><td>      Away!</td></tr><tr><td>    Do as I bid you.- Where's this cup I call'd for?</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY] If for the sake of merit thou wilt hear</td></tr><tr><td>      me,</td></tr><tr><td>    Rise from thy stool.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. [Aside to MENAS] I think th'art mad. [Rises and walks</td></tr><tr><td>    aside] The matter?</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. Thou hast serv'd me with much faith. What's else to say?-</td></tr><tr><td>    Be jolly, lords.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. These quicksands, Lepidus,</td></tr><tr><td>    Keep off them, for you sink.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. Wilt thou be lord of all the world?</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. What say'st thou?</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. How should that be?</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. But entertain it,</td></tr><tr><td>    And though you think me poor, I am the man</td></tr><tr><td>    Will give thee all the world.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. Hast thou drunk well?</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou art, if thou dar'st be, the earthly Jove;</td></tr><tr><td>    Whate'er the ocean pales or sky inclips</td></tr><tr><td>    Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. Show me which way.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. These three world-sharers, these competitors,</td></tr><tr><td>    Are in thy vessel. Let me cut the cable;</td></tr><tr><td>    And when we are put off, fall to their throats.</td></tr><tr><td>    All there is thine.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. Ah, this thou shouldst have done,</td></tr><tr><td>    And not have spoke on't. In me 'tis villainy:</td></tr><tr><td>    In thee't had been good service. Thou must know</td></tr><tr><td>    'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour:</td></tr><tr><td>    Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue</td></tr><tr><td>    Hath so betray'd thine act. Being done unknown,</td></tr><tr><td>    I should have found it afterwards well done,</td></tr><tr><td>    But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. [Aside] For this,</td></tr><tr><td>    I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.</td></tr><tr><td>    Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,</td></tr><tr><td>    Shall never find it more.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. This health to Lepidus!</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Here's to thee, Menas!</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. Enobarbus, welcome!</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. Fill till the cup be hid.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. There's a strong fellow, Menas.</td></tr><tr><td>               [Pointing to the servant who carries off LEPIDUS]</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. Why?</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. 'A bears the third part of the world, man; see'st not?</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. The third part, then, is drunk. Would it were all,</td></tr><tr><td>    That it might go on wheels!</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Drink thou; increase the reels.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. Come.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho!</td></tr><tr><td>    Here's to Caesar!</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. I could well forbear't.</td></tr><tr><td>    It's monstrous labour when I wash my brain</td></tr><tr><td>    And it grows fouler.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Be a child o' th' time.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Possess it, I'll make answer.</td></tr><tr><td>    But I had rather fast from all four days</td></tr><tr><td>    Than drink so much in one.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. [To ANTONY] Ha, my brave emperor!</td></tr><tr><td>    Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals</td></tr><tr><td>    And celebrate our drink?</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. Let's ha't, good soldier.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Come, let's all take hands,</td></tr><tr><td>    Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense</td></tr><tr><td>    In soft and delicate Lethe.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. All take hands.</td></tr><tr><td>    Make battery to our ears with the loud music,</td></tr><tr><td>    The while I'll place you; then the boy shall sing;</td></tr><tr><td>    The holding every man shall bear as loud</td></tr><tr><td>    As his strong sides can volley.</td></tr><tr><td>               [Music plays. ENOBARBUS places them hand in hand]</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                        THE SONG</td></tr><tr><td>            Come, thou monarch of the vine,</td></tr><tr><td>            Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!</td></tr><tr><td>            In thy fats our cares be drown'd,</td></tr><tr><td>            With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd.</td></tr><tr><td>            Cup us till the world go round,</td></tr><tr><td>            Cup us till the world go round!</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,</td></tr><tr><td>    Let me request you off; our graver business</td></tr><tr><td>    Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part;</td></tr><tr><td>    You see we have burnt our cheeks. Strong Enobarb</td></tr><tr><td>    Is weaker than the wine, and mine own tongue</td></tr><tr><td>    Splits what it speaks. The wild disguise hath almost</td></tr><tr><td>    Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.</td></tr><tr><td>    Good Antony, your hand.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. I'll try you on the shore.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. And shall, sir. Give's your hand.</td></tr><tr><td>  POMPEY. O Antony,</td></tr><tr><td>    You have my father's house- but what? We are friends.</td></tr><tr><td>    Come, down into the boat.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Take heed you fall not.</td></tr><tr><td>                              Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS and MENAS</td></tr><tr><td>    Menas, I'll not on shore.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. No, to my cabin.</td></tr><tr><td>    These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!</td></tr><tr><td>    Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell</td></tr><tr><td>    To these great fellows. Sound and be hang'd, sound out!</td></tr><tr><td>                                  [Sound a flourish, with drums]</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Hoo! says 'a. There's my cap.</td></tr><tr><td>  MENAS. Hoo! Noble Captain, come.                        Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td>ACT_3|SC_1</td></tr><tr><td>                     ACT III.

Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck, and now</td></tr><tr><td>    Pleas'd fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death</td></tr><tr><td>    Make me revenger. Bear the King's son's body</td></tr><tr><td>    Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,</td></tr><tr><td>    Pays this for Marcus Crassus.</td></tr><tr><td>  SILIUS. Noble Ventidius,</td></tr><tr><td>    Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm</td></tr><tr><td>    The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,</td></tr><tr><td>    Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither</td></tr><tr><td>    The routed fly. So thy grand captain, Antony,</td></tr><tr><td>    Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and</td></tr><tr><td>    Put garlands on thy head.</td></tr><tr><td>  VENTIDIUS. O Silius, Silius,</td></tr><tr><td>    I have done enough. A lower place, note well,</td></tr><tr><td>    May make too great an act; for learn this, Silius:</td></tr><tr><td>    Better to leave undone than by our deed</td></tr><tr><td>    Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.</td></tr><tr><td>    Caesar and Antony have ever won</td></tr><tr><td>    More in their officer, than person. Sossius,</td></tr><tr><td>    One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,</td></tr><tr><td>    For quick accumulation of renown,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which he achiev'd by th' minute, lost his favour.</td></tr><tr><td>    Who does i' th' wars more than his captain can</td></tr><tr><td>    Becomes his captain's captain; and ambition,</td></tr><tr><td>    The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss</td></tr><tr><td>    Than gain which darkens him.</td></tr><tr><td>    I could do more to do Antonius good,</td></tr><tr><td>    But 'twould offend him; and in his offence</td></tr><tr><td>    Should my performance perish.</td></tr><tr><td>  SILIUS. Thou hast, Ventidius, that</td></tr><tr><td>    Without the which a soldier and his sword</td></tr><tr><td>    Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony?</td></tr><tr><td>  VENTIDIUS. I'll humbly signify what in his name,</td></tr><tr><td>    That magical word of war, we have effected;</td></tr><tr><td>    How, with his banners, and his well-paid ranks,</td></tr><tr><td>    The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia</td></tr><tr><td>    We have jaded out o' th' field.</td></tr><tr><td>  SILIUS. Where is he now?</td></tr><tr><td>  VENTIDIUS. He purposeth to Athens; whither, with what haste</td></tr><tr><td>    The weight we must convey with's will permit,</td></tr><tr><td>    We shall appear before him.- On, there; pass along.</td></tr><tr><td>                                                          Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>ACT_3|SC_2</td></tr><tr><td>                            SCENE II.

What, are the brothers parted?</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. They have dispatch'd with Pompey; he is gone;</td></tr><tr><td>    The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps</td></tr><tr><td>    To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,</td></tr><tr><td>    Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled</td></tr><tr><td>    With the green sickness.</td></tr><tr><td>  AGRIPPA. 'Tis a noble Lepidus.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. A very fine one. O, how he loves Caesar!</td></tr><tr><td>  AGRIPPA. Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Caesar? Why he's the Jupiter of men.</td></tr><tr><td>  AGRIPPA. What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Spake you of Caesar? How! the nonpareil!</td></tr><tr><td>  AGRIPPA. O, Antony! O thou Arabian bird!</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar'- go no further.</td></tr><tr><td>  AGRIPPA. Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. But he loves Caesar best. Yet he loves Antony.</td></tr><tr><td>    Hoo! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, cannot</td></tr><tr><td>    Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number- hoo!-</td></tr><tr><td>    His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,</td></tr><tr><td>    Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.</td></tr><tr><td>  AGRIPPA. Both he loves.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. They are his shards, and he their beetle. [Trumpets</td></tr><tr><td>      within] So-</td></tr><tr><td>    This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.</td></tr><tr><td>  AGRIPPA. Good fortune, worthy soldier, and farewell.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>           Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, and OCTAVIA</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. No further, sir.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. You take from me a great part of myself;</td></tr><tr><td>    Use me well in't. Sister, prove such a wife</td></tr><tr><td>    As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band</td></tr><tr><td>    Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,</td></tr><tr><td>    Let not the piece of virtue which is set</td></tr><tr><td>    Betwixt us as the cement of our love</td></tr><tr><td>    To keep it builded be the ram to batter</td></tr><tr><td>    The fortress of it; for better might we</td></tr><tr><td>    Have lov'd without this mean, if on both parts</td></tr><tr><td>    This be not cherish'd.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Make me not offended</td></tr><tr><td>    In your distrust.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. I have said.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. You shall not find,</td></tr><tr><td>    Though you be therein curious, the least cause</td></tr><tr><td>    For what you seem to fear. So the gods keep you,</td></tr><tr><td>    And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!</td></tr><tr><td>    We will here part.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well.</td></tr><tr><td>    The elements be kind to thee and make</td></tr><tr><td>    Thy spirits all of comfort! Fare thee well.</td></tr><tr><td>  OCTAVIA. My noble brother!</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. The April's in her eyes. It is love's spring,</td></tr><tr><td>    And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful.</td></tr><tr><td>  OCTAVIA. Sir, look well to my husband's house; and-</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. What, Octavia?</td></tr><tr><td>  OCTAVIA. I'll tell you in your ear.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can</td></tr><tr><td>    Her heart inform her tongue- the swan's down feather,</td></tr><tr><td>    That stands upon the swell at the full of tide,</td></tr><tr><td>    And neither way inclines.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. [Aside to AGRIPPA] Will Caesar weep?</td></tr><tr><td>  AGRIPPA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] He has a cloud in's face.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. [Aside to AGRIPPA] He were the worse for that, were he a</td></tr><tr><td>      horse;</td></tr><tr><td>    So is he, being a man.</td></tr><tr><td>  AGRIPPA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] Why, Enobarbus,</td></tr><tr><td>    When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,</td></tr><tr><td>    He cried almost to roaring; and he wept</td></tr><tr><td>    When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. [Aside to AGRIPPA] That year, indeed, he was troubled</td></tr><tr><td>      with a rheum;</td></tr><tr><td>    What willingly he did confound he wail'd,</td></tr><tr><td>    Believe't- till I weep too.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. No, sweet Octavia,</td></tr><tr><td>    You shall hear from me still; the time shall not</td></tr><tr><td>    Out-go my thinking on you.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Come, sir, come;</td></tr><tr><td>    I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love.</td></tr><tr><td>    Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,</td></tr><tr><td>    And give you to the gods.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Adieu; be happy!</td></tr><tr><td>  LEPIDUS. Let all the number of the stars give light</td></tr><tr><td>    To thy fair way!</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Farewell, farewell!

Go to, go to.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                Enter the MESSENGER as before</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>    Come hither, sir.</td></tr><tr><td>  ALEXAS. Good Majesty,</td></tr><tr><td>    Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you</td></tr><tr><td>    But when you are well pleas'd.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. That Herod's head</td></tr><tr><td>    I'll have. But how, when Antony is gone,</td></tr><tr><td>    Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. Most gracious Majesty!</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Didst thou behold Octavia?</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. Ay, dread Queen.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Where?</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. Madam, in Rome</td></tr><tr><td>    I look'd her in the face, and saw her led</td></tr><tr><td>    Between her brother and Mark Antony.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Is she as tall as me?</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. She is not, madam.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Didst hear her speak? Is she shrill-tongu'd or low?</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. Madam, I heard her speak: she is low-voic'd.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. That's not so good. He cannot like her long.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Like her? O Isis! 'tis impossible.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. I think so, Charmian. Dull of tongue and dwarfish!</td></tr><tr><td>    What majesty is in her gait? Remember,</td></tr><tr><td>    If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. She creeps.</td></tr><tr><td>    Her motion and her station are as one;</td></tr><tr><td>    She shows a body rather than a life,</td></tr><tr><td>    A statue than a breather.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Is this certain?</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. Or I have no observance.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Three in Egypt</td></tr><tr><td>    Cannot make better note.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. He's very knowing;</td></tr><tr><td>    I do perceive't. There's nothing in her yet.</td></tr><tr><td>    The fellow has good judgment.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Excellent.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Guess at her years, I prithee.</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. Madam,</td></tr><tr><td>    She was a widow.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Widow? Charmian, hark!</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. And I do think she's thirty.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Bear'st thou her face in mind? Is't long or round?</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. Round even to faultiness.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.</td></tr><tr><td>    Her hair, what colour?</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. Brown, madam; and her forehead</td></tr><tr><td>    As low as she would wish it.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. There's gold for thee.</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou must not take my former sharpness ill.</td></tr><tr><td>    I will employ thee back again; I find thee</td></tr><tr><td>    Most fit for business. Go make thee ready;</td></tr><tr><td>    Our letters are prepar'd.                   Exeunt MESSENGER</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. A proper man.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Indeed, he is so. I repent me much</td></tr><tr><td>    That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,</td></tr><tr><td>    This creature's no such thing.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Nothing, madam.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,</td></tr><tr><td>    And serving you so long!</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian.</td></tr><tr><td>    But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me</td></tr><tr><td>    Where I will write.

Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that-</td></tr><tr><td>    That were excusable, that and thousands more</td></tr><tr><td>    Of semblable import- but he hath wag'd</td></tr><tr><td>    New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it</td></tr><tr><td>    To public ear;</td></tr><tr><td>    Spoke scandy of me; when perforce he could not</td></tr><tr><td>    But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly</td></tr><tr><td>    He vented them, most narrow measure lent me;</td></tr><tr><td>    When the best hint was given him, he not took't,</td></tr><tr><td>    Or did it from his teeth.</td></tr><tr><td>  OCTAVIA. O my good lord,</td></tr><tr><td>    Believe not all; or if you must believe,</td></tr><tr><td>    Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,</td></tr><tr><td>    If this division chance, ne'er stood between,</td></tr><tr><td>    Praying for both parts.</td></tr><tr><td>    The good gods will mock me presently</td></tr><tr><td>    When I shall pray 'O, bless my lord and husband!'</td></tr><tr><td>    Undo that prayer by crying out as loud</td></tr><tr><td>    'O, bless my brother!'

Gentle Octavia,</td></tr><tr><td>    Let your best love draw to that point which seeks</td></tr><tr><td>    Best to preserve it. If I lose mine honour,</td></tr><tr><td>    I lose myself; better I were not yours</td></tr><tr><td>    Than yours so branchless.

Thanks to my lord.</td></tr><tr><td>    The Jove of power make me, most weak, most weak,</td></tr><tr><td>    Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be</td></tr><tr><td>    As if the world should cleave, and that slain men</td></tr><tr><td>    Should solder up the rift.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. When it appears to you where this begins,</td></tr><tr><td>    Turn your displeasure that way, for our faults</td></tr><tr><td>    Can never be so equal that your love</td></tr><tr><td>    Can equally move with them. Provide your going;</td></tr><tr><td>    Choose your own company, and command what cost</td></tr><tr><td>    Your heart has mind to.

There's strange news come, sir.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. What, man?</td></tr><tr><td>  EROS. Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. This is old. What is the success?</td></tr><tr><td>  EROS. Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst Pompey,</td></tr><tr><td>    presently denied him rivality, would not let him partake in the</td></tr><tr><td>    glory of the action; and not resting here, accuses him of letters</td></tr><tr><td>    he had formerly wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him.</td></tr><tr><td>    So the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps- no more;</td></tr><tr><td>    And throw between them all the food thou hast,</td></tr><tr><td>    They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?</td></tr><tr><td>  EROS. He's walking in the garden- thus, and spurns</td></tr><tr><td>    The rush that lies before him; cries 'Fool Lepidus!'</td></tr><tr><td>    And threats the throat of that his officer</td></tr><tr><td>    That murd'red Pompey.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Our great navy's rigg'd.</td></tr><tr><td>  EROS. For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius:</td></tr><tr><td>    My lord desires you presently; my news</td></tr><tr><td>    I might have told hereafter.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. 'Twill be naught;</td></tr><tr><td>    But let it be. Bring me to Antony.</td></tr><tr><td>  EROS. Come, sir.

CAESAR'S house</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>             Enter CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MAECENAS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Contemning Rome, he has done all this and more</td></tr><tr><td>    In Alexandria. Here's the manner of't:</td></tr><tr><td>    I' th' market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,</td></tr><tr><td>    Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold</td></tr><tr><td>    Were publicly enthron'd; at the feet sat</td></tr><tr><td>    Caesarion, whom they call my father's son,</td></tr><tr><td>    And all the unlawful issue that their lust</td></tr><tr><td>    Since then hath made between them. Unto her</td></tr><tr><td>    He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her</td></tr><tr><td>    Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,</td></tr><tr><td>    Absolute queen.</td></tr><tr><td>  MAECENAS. This in the public eye?</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. I' th' common show-place, where they exercise.</td></tr><tr><td>    His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:</td></tr><tr><td>    Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia,</td></tr><tr><td>    He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd</td></tr><tr><td>    Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia. She</td></tr><tr><td>    In th' habiliments of the goddess Isis</td></tr><tr><td>    That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,</td></tr><tr><td>    As 'tis reported, so.</td></tr><tr><td>  MAECENAS. Let Rome be thus</td></tr><tr><td>    Inform'd.</td></tr><tr><td>  AGRIPPA. Who, queasy with his insolence</td></tr><tr><td>    Already, will their good thoughts call from him.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. The people knows it, and have now receiv'd</td></tr><tr><td>    His accusations.</td></tr><tr><td>  AGRIPPA. Who does he accuse?</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Caesar; and that, having in Sicily</td></tr><tr><td>    Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him</td></tr><tr><td>    His part o' th' isle. Then does he say he lent me</td></tr><tr><td>    Some shipping, unrestor'd. Lastly, he frets</td></tr><tr><td>    That Lepidus of the triumvirate</td></tr><tr><td>    Should be depos'd; and, being, that we detain</td></tr><tr><td>    All his revenue.</td></tr><tr><td>  AGRIPPA. Sir, this should be answer'd.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. 'Tis done already, and messenger gone.</td></tr><tr><td>    I have told him Lepidus was grown too cruel,</td></tr><tr><td>    That he his high authority abus'd,</td></tr><tr><td>    And did deserve his change. For what I have conquer'd</td></tr><tr><td>    I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia</td></tr><tr><td>    And other of his conquer'd kingdoms,</td></tr><tr><td>    Demand the like.</td></tr><tr><td>  MAECENAS. He'll never yield to that.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Nor must not then be yielded to in this.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                Enter OCTAVIA, with her train</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  OCTAVIA. Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. That ever I should call thee cast-away!</td></tr><tr><td>  OCTAVIA. You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Why have you stol'n upon us thus? You come not</td></tr><tr><td>    Like Caesar's sister. The wife of Antony</td></tr><tr><td>    Should have an army for an usher, and</td></tr><tr><td>    The neighs of horse to tell of her approach</td></tr><tr><td>    Long ere she did appear. The trees by th' way</td></tr><tr><td>    Should have borne men, and expectation fainted,</td></tr><tr><td>    Longing for what it had not. Nay, the dust</td></tr><tr><td>    Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,</td></tr><tr><td>    Rais'd by your populous troops. But you are come</td></tr><tr><td>    A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented</td></tr><tr><td>    The ostentation of our love, which left unshown</td></tr><tr><td>    Is often left unlov'd. We should have met you</td></tr><tr><td>    By sea and land, supplying every stage</td></tr><tr><td>    With an augmented greeting.</td></tr><tr><td>  OCTAVIA. Good my lord,</td></tr><tr><td>    To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did it</td></tr><tr><td>    On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,</td></tr><tr><td>    Hearing that you prepar'd for war, acquainted</td></tr><tr><td>    My grieved ear withal; whereon I begg'd</td></tr><tr><td>    His pardon for return.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Which soon he granted,</td></tr><tr><td>    Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.</td></tr><tr><td>  OCTAVIA. Do not say so, my lord.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. I have eyes upon him,</td></tr><tr><td>    And his affairs come to me on the wind.</td></tr><tr><td>    Where is he now?</td></tr><tr><td>  OCTAVIA. My lord, in Athens.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. No, my most wronged sister: Cleopatra</td></tr><tr><td>    Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire</td></tr><tr><td>    Up to a whore, who now are levying</td></tr><tr><td>    The kings o' th' earth for war. He hath assembled</td></tr><tr><td>    Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus</td></tr><tr><td>    Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king</td></tr><tr><td>    Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;</td></tr><tr><td>    King Manchus of Arabia; King of Pont;</td></tr><tr><td>    Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king</td></tr><tr><td>    Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,</td></tr><tr><td>    The kings of Mede and Lycaonia, with</td></tr><tr><td>    More larger list of sceptres.</td></tr><tr><td>  OCTAVIA. Ay me most wretched,</td></tr><tr><td>    That have my heart parted betwixt two friends,</td></tr><tr><td>    That does afflict each other!</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Welcome hither.</td></tr><tr><td>    Your letters did withhold our breaking forth,</td></tr><tr><td>    Till we perceiv'd both how you were wrong led</td></tr><tr><td>    And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;</td></tr><tr><td>    Be you not troubled with the time, which drives</td></tr><tr><td>    O'er your content these strong necessities,</td></tr><tr><td>    But let determin'd things to destiny</td></tr><tr><td>    Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;</td></tr><tr><td>    Nothing more dear to me. You are abus'd</td></tr><tr><td>    Beyond the mark of thought, and the high gods,</td></tr><tr><td>    To do you justice, make their ministers</td></tr><tr><td>    Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort,</td></tr><tr><td>    And ever welcome to us.</td></tr><tr><td>  AGRIPPA. Welcome, lady.</td></tr><tr><td>  MAECENAS. Welcome, dear madam.</td></tr><tr><td>    Each heart in Rome does love and pity you;</td></tr><tr><td>    Only th' adulterous Antony, most large</td></tr><tr><td>    In his abominations, turns you off,</td></tr><tr><td>    And gives his potent regiment to a trull</td></tr><tr><td>    That noises it against us.</td></tr><tr><td>  OCTAVIA. Is it so, sir?</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Most certain. Sister, welcome. Pray you</td></tr><tr><td>    Be ever known to patience. My dear'st sister!         Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>ACT_3|SC_7</td></tr><tr><td>                          SCENE VII.</td></tr><tr><td>                  ANTONY'S camp near Actium</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                Enter CLEOPATRA and ENOBARBUS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. I will be even with thee, doubt it not.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. But why, why,</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,</td></tr><tr><td>    And say'st it is not fit.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Well, is it, is it?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Is't not denounc'd against us? Why should not we</td></tr><tr><td>    Be there in person?</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. [Aside] Well, I could reply:</td></tr><tr><td>    If we should serve with horse and mares together</td></tr><tr><td>    The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear</td></tr><tr><td>    A soldier and his horse.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. What is't you say?</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;</td></tr><tr><td>    Take from his heart, take from his brain, from's time,</td></tr><tr><td>    What should not then be spar'd. He is already</td></tr><tr><td>    Traduc'd for levity; and 'tis said in Rome</td></tr><tr><td>    That Photinus an eunuch and your maids</td></tr><tr><td>    Manage this war.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Sink Rome, and their tongues rot</td></tr><tr><td>    That speak against us! A charge we bear i' th' war,</td></tr><tr><td>    And, as the president of my kingdom, will</td></tr><tr><td>    Appear there for a man. Speak not against it;</td></tr><tr><td>    I will not stay behind.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                   Enter ANTONY and CANIDIUS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Nay, I have done.</td></tr><tr><td>    Here comes the Emperor.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Is it not strange, Canidius,</td></tr><tr><td>    That from Tarentum and Brundusium</td></tr><tr><td>    He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,</td></tr><tr><td>    And take in Toryne?- You have heard on't, sweet?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Celerity is never more admir'd</td></tr><tr><td>    Than by the negligent.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. A good rebuke,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which might have well becom'd the best of men</td></tr><tr><td>    To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we</td></tr><tr><td>    Will fight with him by sea.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. By sea! What else?</td></tr><tr><td>  CANIDIUS. Why will my lord do so?</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. For that he dares us to't.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. So hath my lord dar'd him to single fight.</td></tr><tr><td>  CANIDIUS. Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia,</td></tr><tr><td>    Where Caesar fought with Pompey. But these offers,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off;</td></tr><tr><td>    And so should you.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Your ships are not well mann'd;</td></tr><tr><td>    Your mariners are muleteers, reapers, people</td></tr><tr><td>    Ingross'd by swift impress. In Caesar's fleet</td></tr><tr><td>    Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought;</td></tr><tr><td>    Their ships are yare; yours heavy. No disgrace</td></tr><tr><td>    Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,</td></tr><tr><td>    Being prepar'd for land.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. By sea, by sea.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Most worthy sir, you therein throw away</td></tr><tr><td>    The absolute soldiership you have by land;</td></tr><tr><td>    Distract your army, which doth most consist</td></tr><tr><td>    Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted</td></tr><tr><td>    Your own renowned knowledge; quite forgo</td></tr><tr><td>    The way which promises assurance; and</td></tr><tr><td>    Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard</td></tr><tr><td>    From firm security.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. I'll fight at sea.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Our overplus of shipping will we burn,</td></tr><tr><td>    And, with the rest full-mann'd, from th' head of Actium</td></tr><tr><td>    Beat th' approaching Caesar. But if we fail,</td></tr><tr><td>    We then can do't at land.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                       Enter a MESSENGER</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>    Thy business?</td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. The news is true, my lord: he is descried;</td></tr><tr><td>    Caesar has taken Toryne.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Can he be there in person? 'Tis impossible-</td></tr><tr><td>    Strange that his power should be. Canidius,</td></tr><tr><td>    Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,</td></tr><tr><td>    And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship.</td></tr><tr><td>    Away, my Thetis!</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                       Enter a SOLDIER</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>    How now, worthy soldier?</td></tr><tr><td>  SOLDIER. O noble Emperor, do not fight by sea;</td></tr><tr><td>    Trust not to rotten planks. Do you misdoubt</td></tr><tr><td>    This sword and these my wounds? Let th' Egyptians</td></tr><tr><td>    And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we</td></tr><tr><td>    Have us'd to conquer standing on the earth</td></tr><tr><td>    And fighting foot to foot.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Well, well- away.</td></tr><tr><td>                         Exeunt ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, and ENOBARBUS</td></tr><tr><td>  SOLDIER. By Hercules, I think I am i' th' right.</td></tr><tr><td>  CANIDIUS. Soldier, thou art; but his whole action grows</td></tr><tr><td>    Not in the power on't. So our leader's led,</td></tr><tr><td>    And we are women's men.</td></tr><tr><td>  SOLDIER. You keep by land</td></tr><tr><td>    The legions and the horse whole, do you not?</td></tr><tr><td>  CANIDIUS. Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,</td></tr><tr><td>    Publicola, and Caelius are for sea;</td></tr><tr><td>    But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's</td></tr><tr><td>    Carries beyond belief.</td></tr><tr><td>  SOLDIER. While he was yet in Rome,</td></tr><tr><td>    His power went out in such distractions as</td></tr><tr><td>    Beguil'd all spies.</td></tr><tr><td>  CANIDIUS. Who's his lieutenant, hear you?</td></tr><tr><td>  SOLDIER. They say one Taurus.</td></tr><tr><td>  CANIDIUS. Well I know the man.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                        Enter a MESSENGER</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  MESSENGER. The Emperor calls Canidius.</td></tr><tr><td>  CANIDIUS. With news the time's with labour and throes forth</td></tr><tr><td>    Each minute some.

Enter ENOBARBUS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Naught, naught, all naught! I can behold no longer.</td></tr><tr><td>    Th' Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,</td></tr><tr><td>    With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder.</td></tr><tr><td>    To see't mine eyes are blasted.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                        Enter SCARUS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  SCARUS. Gods and goddesses,</td></tr><tr><td>    All the whole synod of them!</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. What's thy passion?</td></tr><tr><td>  SCARUS. The greater cantle of the world is lost</td></tr><tr><td>    With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away</td></tr><tr><td>    Kingdoms and provinces.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. How appears the fight?</td></tr><tr><td>  SCARUS. On our side like the token'd pestilence,</td></tr><tr><td>    Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt-</td></tr><tr><td>    Whom leprosy o'ertake!- i' th' midst o' th' fight,</td></tr><tr><td>    When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,</td></tr><tr><td>    Both as the same, or rather ours the elder-</td></tr><tr><td>    The breese upon her, like a cow in June-</td></tr><tr><td>    Hoists sails and flies.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. That I beheld;</td></tr><tr><td>    Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not</td></tr><tr><td>    Endure a further view.</td></tr><tr><td>  SCARUS. She once being loof'd,</td></tr><tr><td>    The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,</td></tr><tr><td>    Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,</td></tr><tr><td>    Leaving the fight in height, flies after her.</td></tr><tr><td>    I never saw an action of such shame;</td></tr><tr><td>    Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before</td></tr><tr><td>    Did violate so itself.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Alack, alack!</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                       Enter CANIDIUS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  CANIDIUS. Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,</td></tr><tr><td>    And sinks most lamentably. Had our general</td></tr><tr><td>    Been what he knew himself, it had gone well.</td></tr><tr><td>    O, he has given example for our flight</td></tr><tr><td>    Most grossly by his own!</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Ay, are you thereabouts?</td></tr><tr><td>    Why then, good night indeed.</td></tr><tr><td>  CANIDIUS. Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.</td></tr><tr><td>  SCARUS. 'Tis easy to't; and there I will attend</td></tr><tr><td>    What further comes.</td></tr><tr><td>  CANIDIUS. To Caesar will I render</td></tr><tr><td>    My legions and my horse; six kings already</td></tr><tr><td>    Show me the way of yielding.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. I'll yet follow</td></tr><tr><td>    The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason</td></tr><tr><td>    Sits in the wind against me.

Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;</td></tr><tr><td>    It is asham'd to bear me. Friends, come hither.</td></tr><tr><td>    I am so lated in the world that I</td></tr><tr><td>    Have lost my way for ever. I have a ship</td></tr><tr><td>    Laden with gold; take that; divide it. Fly,</td></tr><tr><td>    And make your peace with Caesar.</td></tr><tr><td>  ALL. Fly? Not we!</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. I have fled myself, and have instructed cowards</td></tr><tr><td>    To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;</td></tr><tr><td>    I have myself resolv'd upon a course</td></tr><tr><td>    Which has no need of you; be gone.</td></tr><tr><td>    My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,</td></tr><tr><td>    I follow'd that I blush to look upon.</td></tr><tr><td>    My very hairs do mutiny; for the white</td></tr><tr><td>    Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them</td></tr><tr><td>    For fear and doting. Friends, be gone; you shall</td></tr><tr><td>    Have letters from me to some friends that will</td></tr><tr><td>    Sweep your way for you. Pray you look not sad,</td></tr><tr><td>    Nor make replies of loathness; take the hint</td></tr><tr><td>    Which my despair proclaims. Let that be left</td></tr><tr><td>    Which leaves itself. To the sea-side straight way.</td></tr><tr><td>    I will possess you of that ship and treasure.</td></tr><tr><td>    Leave me, I pray, a little; pray you now;</td></tr><tr><td>    Nay, do so, for indeed I have lost command;</td></tr><tr><td>    Therefore I pray you. I'll see you by and by.    [Sits down]</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>            Enter CLEOPATRA, led by CHARMIAN and IRAS,</td></tr><tr><td>                         EROS following</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  EROS. Nay, gentle madam, to him! Comfort him.</td></tr><tr><td>  IRAS. Do, most dear Queen.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Do? Why, what else?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Let me sit down. O Juno!</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. No, no, no, no, no.</td></tr><tr><td>  EROS. See you here, sir?</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. O, fie, fie, fie!</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Madam!</td></tr><tr><td>  IRAS. Madam, O good Empress!</td></tr><tr><td>  EROS. Sir, sir!</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Yes, my lord, yes. He at Philippi kept</td></tr><tr><td>    His sword e'en like a dancer, while I struck</td></tr><tr><td>    The lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I</td></tr><tr><td>    That the mad Brutus ended; he alone</td></tr><tr><td>    Dealt on lieutenantry, and no practice had</td></tr><tr><td>    In the brave squares of war. Yet now- no matter.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Ah, stand by!</td></tr><tr><td>  EROS. The Queen, my lord, the Queen!</td></tr><tr><td>  IRAS. Go to him, madam, speak to him.</td></tr><tr><td>    He is unqualitied with very shame.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Well then, sustain me. O!</td></tr><tr><td> EROS. Most noble sir, arise; the Queen approaches.</td></tr><tr><td>    Her head's declin'd, and death will seize her but</td></tr><tr><td>    Your comfort makes the rescue.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. I have offended reputation-</td></tr><tr><td>    A most unnoble swerving.</td></tr><tr><td>  EROS. Sir, the Queen.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See</td></tr><tr><td>    How I convey my shame out of thine eyes</td></tr><tr><td>    By looking back what I have left behind</td></tr><tr><td>    'Stroy'd in dishonour.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. O my lord, my lord,</td></tr><tr><td>    Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought</td></tr><tr><td>    You would have followed.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Egypt, thou knew'st too well</td></tr><tr><td>    My heart was to thy rudder tied by th' strings,</td></tr><tr><td>    And thou shouldst tow me after. O'er my spirit</td></tr><tr><td>    Thy full supremacy thou knew'st, and that</td></tr><tr><td>    Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods</td></tr><tr><td>    Command me.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. O, my pardon!</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Now I must</td></tr><tr><td>    To the young man send humble treaties, dodge</td></tr><tr><td>    And palter in the shifts of lowness, who</td></tr><tr><td>    With half the bulk o' th' world play'd as I pleas'd,</td></tr><tr><td>    Making and marring fortunes. You did know</td></tr><tr><td>    How much you were my conqueror, and that</td></tr><tr><td>    My sword, made weak by my affection, would</td></tr><tr><td>    Obey it on all cause.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Pardon, pardon!</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates</td></tr><tr><td>    All that is won and lost. Give me a kiss;</td></tr><tr><td>    Even this repays me.</td></tr><tr><td>    We sent our schoolmaster; is 'a come back?</td></tr><tr><td>    Love, I am full of lead. Some wine,</td></tr><tr><td>    Within there, and our viands! Fortune knows</td></tr><tr><td>    We scorn her most when most she offers blows.         Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>ACT_3|SC_12</td></tr><tr><td>                         SCENE XII.</td></tr><tr><td>                   CAESAR'S camp in Egypt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>   Enter CAESAR, AGRIPPA, DOLABELLA, THYREUS, with others</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Let him appear that's come from Antony.</td></tr><tr><td>    Know you him?</td></tr><tr><td>  DOLABELLA. Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster:</td></tr><tr><td>    An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither</td></tr><tr><td>    He sends so poor a pinion of his wing,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which had superfluous kings for messengers</td></tr><tr><td>    Not many moons gone by.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>            Enter EUPHRONIUS, Ambassador from ANTONY</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Approach, and speak.</td></tr><tr><td>  EUPHRONIUS. Such as I am, I come from Antony.</td></tr><tr><td>    I was of late as petty to his ends</td></tr><tr><td>    As is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf</td></tr><tr><td>    To his grand sea.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Be't so. Declare thine office.</td></tr><tr><td>  EUPHRONIUS. Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and</td></tr><tr><td>    Requires to live in Egypt; which not granted,</td></tr><tr><td>    He lessens his requests and to thee sues</td></tr><tr><td>    To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,</td></tr><tr><td>    A private man in Athens. This for him.</td></tr><tr><td>    Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness,</td></tr><tr><td>    Submits her to thy might, and of thee craves</td></tr><tr><td>    The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,</td></tr><tr><td>    Now hazarded to thy grace.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. For Antony,</td></tr><tr><td>    I have no ears to his request. The Queen</td></tr><tr><td>    Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she</td></tr><tr><td>    From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,</td></tr><tr><td>    Or take his life there. This if she perform,</td></tr><tr><td>    She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.</td></tr><tr><td>  EUPHRONIUS. Fortune pursue thee!</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Bring him through the bands.           Exit EUPHRONIUS</td></tr><tr><td>    [To THYREUS] To try thy eloquence, now 'tis time. Dispatch;</td></tr><tr><td>    From Antony win Cleopatra. Promise,</td></tr><tr><td>    And in our name, what she requires; add more,</td></tr><tr><td>    From thine invention, offers. Women are not</td></tr><tr><td>    In their best fortunes strong; but want will perjure</td></tr><tr><td>    The ne'er-touch'd vestal. Try thy cunning, Thyreus;</td></tr><tr><td>    Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we</td></tr><tr><td>    Will answer as a law.</td></tr><tr><td>  THYREUS. Caesar, I go.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,</td></tr><tr><td>    And what thou think'st his very action speaks</td></tr><tr><td>    In every power that moves.</td></tr><tr><td>  THYREUS. Caesar, I shall.                               Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>ACT_3|SC_13</td></tr><tr><td>                           SCENE XIII.</td></tr><tr><td>               Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>        Enter CLEOPATRA, ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, and IRAS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. What shall we do, Enobarbus?</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Think, and die.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Is Antony or we in fault for this?</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Antony only, that would make his will</td></tr><tr><td>    Lord of his reason. What though you fled</td></tr><tr><td>    From that great face of war, whose several ranges</td></tr><tr><td>    Frighted each other? Why should he follow?</td></tr><tr><td>    The itch of his affection should not then</td></tr><tr><td>    Have nick'd his captainship, at such a point,</td></tr><tr><td>    When half to half the world oppos'd, he being</td></tr><tr><td>    The mered question. 'Twas a shame no less</td></tr><tr><td>    Than was his loss, to course your flying flags</td></tr><tr><td>    And leave his navy gazing.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Prithee, peace.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>          Enter EUPHRONIUS, the Ambassador; with ANTONY</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Is that his answer?</td></tr><tr><td>  EUPHRONIUS. Ay, my lord.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. The Queen shall then have courtesy, so she</td></tr><tr><td>    Will yield us up.</td></tr><tr><td>  EUPHRONIUS. He says so.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Let her know't.</td></tr><tr><td>    To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,</td></tr><tr><td>    And he will fill thy wishes to the brim</td></tr><tr><td>    With principalities.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. That head, my lord?</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. To him again. Tell him he wears the rose</td></tr><tr><td>    Of youth upon him; from which the world should note</td></tr><tr><td>    Something particular. His coin, ships, legions,</td></tr><tr><td>    May be a coward's whose ministers would prevail</td></tr><tr><td>    Under the service of a child as soon</td></tr><tr><td>    As i' th' command of Caesar. I dare him therefore</td></tr><tr><td>    To lay his gay comparisons apart,</td></tr><tr><td>    And answer me declin'd, sword against sword,</td></tr><tr><td>    Ourselves alone. I'll write it. Follow me.</td></tr><tr><td>                                    Exeunt ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS</td></tr><tr><td>  EUPHRONIUS. [Aside] Yes, like enough high-battled Caesar will</td></tr><tr><td>    Unstate his happiness, and be stag'd to th' show</td></tr><tr><td>    Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are</td></tr><tr><td>    A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward</td></tr><tr><td>    Do draw the inward quality after them,</td></tr><tr><td>    To suffer all alike. That he should dream,</td></tr><tr><td>    Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will</td></tr><tr><td>    Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdu'd</td></tr><tr><td>    His judgment too.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                       Enter a SERVANT</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  SERVANT. A messenger from Caesar.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. What, no more ceremony? See, my women!</td></tr><tr><td>    Against the blown rose may they stop their nose</td></tr><tr><td>    That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir.     Exit SERVANT</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. [Aside] Mine honesty and I begin to square.</td></tr><tr><td>    The loyalty well held to fools does make</td></tr><tr><td>    Our faith mere folly. Yet he that can endure</td></tr><tr><td>    To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord</td></tr><tr><td>    Does conquer him that did his master conquer,</td></tr><tr><td>    And earns a place i' th' story.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                       Enter THYREUS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Caesar's will?</td></tr><tr><td>  THYREUS. Hear it apart.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. None but friends: say boldly.</td></tr><tr><td>  THYREUS. So, haply, are they friends to Antony.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has,</td></tr><tr><td>    Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master</td></tr><tr><td>    Will leap to be his friend. For us, you know</td></tr><tr><td>    Whose he is we are, and that is Caesar's.</td></tr><tr><td>  THYREUS. So.</td></tr><tr><td>    Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats</td></tr><tr><td>    Not to consider in what case thou stand'st</td></tr><tr><td>    Further than he is Caesar.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Go on. Right royal!</td></tr><tr><td>  THYREUS. He knows that you embrace not Antony</td></tr><tr><td>    As you did love, but as you fear'd him.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. O!</td></tr><tr><td>  THYREUS. The scars upon your honour, therefore, he</td></tr><tr><td>    Does pity, as constrained blemishes,</td></tr><tr><td>    Not as deserv'd.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. He is a god, and knows</td></tr><tr><td>    What is most right. Mine honour was not yielded,</td></tr><tr><td>    But conquer'd merely.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. [Aside] To be sure of that,</td></tr><tr><td>    I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky</td></tr><tr><td>    That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for</td></tr><tr><td>    Thy dearest quit thee.                                  Exit</td></tr><tr><td>  THYREUS. Shall I say to Caesar</td></tr><tr><td>    What you require of him? For he partly begs</td></tr><tr><td>    To be desir'd to give. It much would please him</td></tr><tr><td>    That of his fortunes you should make a staff</td></tr><tr><td>    To lean upon. But it would warm his spirits</td></tr><tr><td>    To hear from me you had left Antony,</td></tr><tr><td>    And put yourself under his shroud,</td></tr><tr><td>    The universal landlord.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. What's your name?</td></tr><tr><td>  THYREUS. My name is Thyreus.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Most kind messenger,</td></tr><tr><td>    Say to great Caesar this: in deputation</td></tr><tr><td>    I kiss his conquring hand. Tell him I am prompt</td></tr><tr><td>    To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel.</td></tr><tr><td>    Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear</td></tr><tr><td>    The doom of Egypt.</td></tr><tr><td>  THYREUS. 'Tis your noblest course.</td></tr><tr><td>    Wisdom and fortune combating together,</td></tr><tr><td>    If that the former dare but what it can,</td></tr><tr><td>    No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay</td></tr><tr><td>    My duty on your hand.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Your Caesar's father oft,</td></tr><tr><td>    When he hath mus'd of taking kingdoms in,</td></tr><tr><td>    Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,</td></tr><tr><td>    As it rain'd kisses.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                Re-enter ANTONY and ENOBARBUS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Favours, by Jove that thunders!</td></tr><tr><td>    What art thou, fellow?</td></tr><tr><td>  THYREUS. One that but performs</td></tr><tr><td>    The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest</td></tr><tr><td>    To have command obey'd.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. [Aside] You will be whipt.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Approach there.- Ah, you kite!- Now, gods and devils!</td></tr><tr><td>    Authority melts from me. Of late, when I cried 'Ho!'</td></tr><tr><td>    Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth</td></tr><tr><td>    And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am</td></tr><tr><td>    Antony yet.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                       Enter servants</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>    Take hence this Jack and whip him.</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. 'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp</td></tr><tr><td>    Than with an old one dying.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Moon and stars!</td></tr><tr><td>    Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries</td></tr><tr><td>    That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them</td></tr><tr><td>    So saucy with the hand of she here- what's her name</td></tr><tr><td>    Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,</td></tr><tr><td>    Till like a boy you see him cringe his face,</td></tr><tr><td>    And whine aloud for mercy. Take him hence.</td></tr><tr><td>  THYMUS. Mark Antony-</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Tug him away. Being whipt,</td></tr><tr><td>    Bring him again: the Jack of Caesar's shall</td></tr><tr><td>    Bear us an errand to him.       Exeunt servants with THYREUS</td></tr><tr><td>    You were half blasted ere I knew you. Ha!</td></tr><tr><td>    Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,</td></tr><tr><td>    Forborne the getting of a lawful race,</td></tr><tr><td>    And by a gem of women, to be abus'd</td></tr><tr><td>    By one that looks on feeders?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Good my lord-</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. You have been a boggler ever.</td></tr><tr><td>    But when we in our viciousness grow hard-</td></tr><tr><td>    O misery on't!- the wise gods seel our eyes,</td></tr><tr><td>    In our own filth drop our clear judgments, make us</td></tr><tr><td>    Adore our errors, laugh at's while we strut</td></tr><tr><td>    To our confusion.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. O, is't come to this?</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. I found you as a morsel cold upon</td></tr><tr><td>    Dead Caesar's trencher. Nay, you were a fragment</td></tr><tr><td>    Of Cneius Pompey's, besides what hotter hours,</td></tr><tr><td>    Unregist'red in vulgar fame, you have</td></tr><tr><td>    Luxuriously pick'd out; for I am sure,</td></tr><tr><td>    Though you can guess what temperance should be,</td></tr><tr><td>    You know not what it is.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Wherefore is this?</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. To let a fellow that will take rewards,</td></tr><tr><td>    And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with</td></tr><tr><td>    My playfellow, your hand, this kingly seal</td></tr><tr><td>    And plighter of high hearts! O that I were</td></tr><tr><td>    Upon the hill of Basan to outroar</td></tr><tr><td>    The horned herd! For I have savage cause,</td></tr><tr><td>    And to proclaim it civilly were like</td></tr><tr><td>    A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank</td></tr><tr><td>    For being yare about him.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>              Re-enter a SERVANT with THYREUS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>    Is he whipt?</td></tr><tr><td>  SERVANT. Soundly, my lord.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Cried he? and begg'd 'a pardon?</td></tr><tr><td>  SERVANT. He did ask favour.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. If that thy father live, let him repent</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry</td></tr><tr><td>    To follow Caesar in his triumph, since</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou hast been whipt for following him. Henceforth</td></tr><tr><td>    The white hand of a lady fever thee!</td></tr><tr><td>    Shake thou to look on't. Get thee back to Caesar;</td></tr><tr><td>    Tell him thy entertainment; look thou say</td></tr><tr><td>    He makes me angry with him; for he seems</td></tr><tr><td>    Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,</td></tr><tr><td>    Not what he knew I was. He makes me angry;</td></tr><tr><td>    And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,</td></tr><tr><td>    When my good stars, that were my former guides,</td></tr><tr><td>    Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires</td></tr><tr><td>    Into th' abysm of hell.

Urge it thou.</td></tr><tr><td>    Hence with thy stripes, be gone.                Exit THYREUS</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Have you done yet?</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Alack, our terrene moon</td></tr><tr><td>    Is now eclips'd, and it portends alone</td></tr><tr><td>    The fall of Antony.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. I must stay his time.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes</td></tr><tr><td>    With one that ties his points?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Not know me yet?</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Cold-hearted toward me?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Ah, dear, if I be so,</td></tr><tr><td>    From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,</td></tr><tr><td>    And poison it in the source, and the first stone</td></tr><tr><td>    Drop in my neck; as it determines, so</td></tr><tr><td>    Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!</td></tr><tr><td>    Till by degrees the memory of my womb,</td></tr><tr><td>    Together with my brave Egyptians all,</td></tr><tr><td>    By the discandying of this pelleted storm,</td></tr><tr><td>    Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile</td></tr><tr><td>    Have buried them for prey.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. I am satisfied.</td></tr><tr><td>    Caesar sits down in Alexandria, where</td></tr><tr><td>    I will oppose his fate. Our force by land</td></tr><tr><td>    Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy to</td></tr><tr><td>    Have knit again, and fleet, threat'ning most sea-like.</td></tr><tr><td>    Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?</td></tr><tr><td>    If from the field I shall return once more</td></tr><tr><td>    To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood.</td></tr><tr><td>    I and my sword will earn our chronicle.</td></tr><tr><td>    There's hope in't yet.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. That's my brave lord!</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breath'd,</td></tr><tr><td>    And fight maliciously. For when mine hours</td></tr><tr><td>    Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives</td></tr><tr><td>    Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,</td></tr><tr><td>    And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,</td></tr><tr><td>    Let's have one other gaudy night. Call to me</td></tr><tr><td>    All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;</td></tr><tr><td>    Let's mock the midnight bell.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. It is my birthday.</td></tr><tr><td>    I had thought t'have held it poor; but since my lord</td></tr><tr><td>    Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. We will yet do well.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Call all his noble captains to my lord.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force</td></tr><tr><td>    The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen,</td></tr><tr><td>    There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight</td></tr><tr><td>    I'll make death love me; for I will contend</td></tr><tr><td>    Even with his pestilent scythe.     Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious</td></tr><tr><td>    Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood</td></tr><tr><td>    The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still</td></tr><tr><td>    A diminution in our captain's brain</td></tr><tr><td>    Restores his heart. When valour preys on reason,</td></tr><tr><td>    It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek</td></tr><tr><td>    Some way to leave him.

He calls me boy, and chides as he had power</td></tr><tr><td>    To beat me out of Egypt.

Let the old ruffian know</td></tr><tr><td>    I have many other ways to die, meantime</td></tr><tr><td>    Laugh at his challenge.</td></tr><tr><td>  MAECENAS. Caesar must think</td></tr><tr><td>    When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted</td></tr><tr><td>    Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now</td></tr><tr><td>    Make boot of his distraction. Never anger</td></tr><tr><td>    Made good guard for itself.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Let our best heads</td></tr><tr><td>    Know that to-morrow the last of many battles</td></tr><tr><td>    We mean to fight. Within our files there are</td></tr><tr><td>    Of those that serv'd Mark Antony but late</td></tr><tr><td>    Enough to fetch him in.

He will not fight with me, Domitius?</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. No.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Why should he not?</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,</td></tr><tr><td>    He is twenty men to one.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. To-morrow, soldier,</td></tr><tr><td>    By sea and land I'll fight. Or I will live,</td></tr><tr><td>    Or bathe my dying honour in the blood</td></tr><tr><td>    Shall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well?</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. I'll strike, and cry 'Take all.'</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Well said; come on.</td></tr><tr><td>    Call forth my household servants; let's to-night</td></tr><tr><td>    Be bounteous at our meal.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                Enter three or four servitors</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>    Give me thy hand,</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou has been rightly honest.

[Aside to ENOBARBUS] What means this?</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS. [Aside to CLEOPATRA] 'Tis one of those odd tricks which</td></tr><tr><td>      sorrow shoots</td></tr><tr><td>    Out of the mind.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. And thou art honest too.</td></tr><tr><td>    I wish I could be made so many men,</td></tr><tr><td>    And all of you clapp'd up together in</td></tr><tr><td>    An Antony, that I might do you service</td></tr><tr><td>    So good as you have done.</td></tr><tr><td>  SERVANT. The gods forbid!</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night.</td></tr><tr><td>    Scant not my cups, and make as much of me</td></tr><tr><td>    As when mine empire was your fellow too,</td></tr><tr><td>    And suffer'd my command.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] What does he mean?</td></tr><tr><td>    ENOBARBUS. [Aside to CLEOPATRA] To make his followers weep.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Tend me to-night;</td></tr><tr><td>    May be it is the period of your duty.</td></tr><tr><td>    Haply you shall not see me more; or if,</td></tr><tr><td>    A mangled shadow. Perchance to-morrow</td></tr><tr><td>    You'll serve another master. I look on you</td></tr><tr><td>    As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,</td></tr><tr><td>    I turn you not away; but, like a master</td></tr><tr><td>    Married to your good service, stay till death.</td></tr><tr><td>    Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,</td></tr><tr><td>    And the gods yield you for't!</td></tr><tr><td>  ENOBARBUS.

Know, my hearts,</td></tr><tr><td>    I hope well of to-morrow, and will lead you</td></tr><tr><td>    Where rather I'll expect victorious life</td></tr><tr><td>    Than death and honour.

Under the earth.</td></tr><tr><td>  THIRD SOLDIER. It signs well, does it not?</td></tr><tr><td>  FOURTH SOLDIER. No.</td></tr><tr><td>  THIRD SOLDIER.

[Speaking together] How now!</td></tr><tr><td>    How now! Do you hear this?</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. Ay; is't not strange?</td></tr><tr><td>  THIRD SOLDIER. Do you hear, masters? Do you hear?</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST SOLDIER. Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;</td></tr><tr><td>    Let's see how it will give off.</td></tr><tr><td>  SOLDIERS. Content.

Rarely, rarely!</td></tr><tr><td>    He that unbuckles this, till we do please</td></tr><tr><td>    To daff't for our repose, shall hear a storm.</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou fumblest, Eros, and my queen's a squire</td></tr><tr><td>    More tight at this than thou.

Eros, thou yet behold'st me?</td></tr><tr><td>  EROS. Ay, noble lord.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Sometime we see a cloud that's dragonish;</td></tr><tr><td>    A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,</td></tr><tr><td>    A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,</td></tr><tr><td>    A forked mountain, or blue promontory</td></tr><tr><td>    With trees upon't that nod unto the world</td></tr><tr><td>    And mock our eyes with air. Thou hast seen these signs;</td></tr><tr><td>    They are black vesper's pageants.</td></tr><tr><td>  EROS. Ay, my lord.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. That which is now a horse, even with a thought</td></tr><tr><td>    The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,</td></tr><tr><td>    As water is in water.</td></tr><tr><td>  EROS. It does, my lord.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. My good knave Eros, now thy captain is</td></tr><tr><td>    Even such a body. Here I am Antony;</td></tr><tr><td>    Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.</td></tr><tr><td>    I made these wars for Egypt; and the Queen-</td></tr><tr><td>    Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which, whilst it was mine, had annex'd unto't</td></tr><tr><td>    A million moe, now lost- she, Eros, has</td></tr><tr><td>    Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory</td></tr><tr><td>    Unto an enemy's triumph.</td></tr><tr><td>    Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left us</td></tr><tr><td>    Ourselves to end ourselves.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                         Enter MARDIAN</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>    O, thy vile lady!</td></tr><tr><td>    She has robb'd me of my sword.</td></tr><tr><td>  MARDIAN. No, Antony;</td></tr><tr><td>    My mistress lov'd thee, and her fortunes mingled</td></tr><tr><td>    With thine entirely.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!</td></tr><tr><td>    She hath betray'd me, and shall die the death.</td></tr><tr><td>  MARDIAN. Death of one person can be paid but once,</td></tr><tr><td>    And that she has discharg'd. What thou wouldst do</td></tr><tr><td>    Is done unto thy hand. The last she spake</td></tr><tr><td>    Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!'</td></tr><tr><td>    Then in the midst a tearing groan did break</td></tr><tr><td>    The name of Antony; it was divided</td></tr><tr><td>    Between her heart and lips. She rend'red life,</td></tr><tr><td>    Thy name so buried in her.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Dead then?</td></tr><tr><td>  MARDIAN. Dead.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,</td></tr><tr><td>    And we must sleep. That thou depart'st hence safe</td></tr><tr><td>    Does pay thy labour richly. Go.                 Exit MARDIAN</td></tr><tr><td>    Off, pluck off!</td></tr><tr><td>    The sevenfold shield of Ajax cannot keep</td></tr><tr><td>    The battery from my heart.

Exit EROS</td></tr><tr><td>    I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and</td></tr><tr><td>    Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now</td></tr><tr><td>    All length is torture. Since the torch is out,</td></tr><tr><td>    Lie down, and stray no farther. Now all labour</td></tr><tr><td>    Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles</td></tr><tr><td>    Itself with strength. Seal then, and all is done.</td></tr><tr><td>    Eros!- I come, my queen.- Eros!- Stay for me;</td></tr><tr><td>    Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,</td></tr><tr><td>    And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze.</td></tr><tr><td>    Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops,</td></tr><tr><td>    And all the haunt be ours.- Come, Eros, Eros!</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                       Re-enter EROS</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  EROS. What would my lord?</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Since Cleopatra died,</td></tr><tr><td>    I have liv'd in such dishonour that the gods</td></tr><tr><td>    Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword</td></tr><tr><td>    Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back</td></tr><tr><td>    With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack</td></tr><tr><td>    The courage of a woman; less noble mind</td></tr><tr><td>    Than she which by her death our Caesar tells</td></tr><tr><td>    'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,</td></tr><tr><td>    That, when the exigent should come- which now</td></tr><tr><td>    Is come indeed- when I should see behind me</td></tr><tr><td>    Th' inevitable prosecution of</td></tr><tr><td>    Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou then wouldst kill me. Do't; the time is come.</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou strik'st not me; 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.</td></tr><tr><td>    Put colour in thy cheek.</td></tr><tr><td>  EROS. The gods withhold me!</td></tr><tr><td>    Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,</td></tr><tr><td>    Though enemy, lost aim and could not?</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Eros,</td></tr><tr><td>    Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see</td></tr><tr><td>    Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down</td></tr><tr><td>    His corrigible neck, his face subdu'd</td></tr><tr><td>    To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat</td></tr><tr><td>    Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded</td></tr><tr><td>    His baseness that ensued?</td></tr><tr><td>  EROS. I would not see't.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Come, then; for with a wound I must be cur'd.</td></tr><tr><td>    Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn</td></tr><tr><td>    Most useful for thy country.</td></tr><tr><td>  EROS. O, sir, pardon me!</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. When I did make thee free, swor'st thou not then</td></tr><tr><td>    To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once,</td></tr><tr><td>    Or thy precedent services are all</td></tr><tr><td>    But accidents unpurpos'd. Draw, and come.</td></tr><tr><td>  EROS. Turn from me then that noble countenance,</td></tr><tr><td>    Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Lo thee!                            [Turning from him]</td></tr><tr><td>  EROS. My sword is drawn.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Then let it do at once</td></tr><tr><td>    The thing why thou hast drawn it.</td></tr><tr><td>  EROS. My dear master,</td></tr><tr><td>    My captain and my emperor, let me say,</td></tr><tr><td>    Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. 'Tis said, man; and farewell.</td></tr><tr><td>  EROS. Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Now, Eros.</td></tr><tr><td>  EROS. Why, there then! Thus do I escape the sorrow</td></tr><tr><td>    Of Antony's death.                            [Kills himself</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Thrice nobler than myself!</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what</td></tr><tr><td>    I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros</td></tr><tr><td>    Have, by their brave instruction, got upon me</td></tr><tr><td>    A nobleness in record. But I will be</td></tr><tr><td>    A bridegroom in my death, and run into't</td></tr><tr><td>    As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,</td></tr><tr><td>    Thy master dies thy scholar. To do thus</td></tr><tr><td>                                          [Falling on his sword]</td></tr><tr><td>    I learn'd of thee. How? not dead? not dead?-</td></tr><tr><td>    The guard, ho!

And time is at his period.</td></tr><tr><td>  ALL. Alas, and woe!</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Let him that loves me, strike me dead.</td></tr><tr><td>  FIRST GUARD.

Exit DERCETAS</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword and give me</td></tr><tr><td>    Sufficing strokes for death.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIOMEDES. Most absolute lord,</td></tr><tr><td>    My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. When did she send thee?</td></tr><tr><td>  DIOMEDES. Now, my lord.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Where is she?</td></tr><tr><td>  DIOMEDES. Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear</td></tr><tr><td>    Of what hath come to pass; for when she saw-</td></tr><tr><td>    Which never shall be found- you did suspect</td></tr><tr><td>    She had dispos'd with Caesar, and that your rage</td></tr><tr><td>    Would not be purg'd, she sent you word she was dead;</td></tr><tr><td>    But fearing since how it might work, hath sent</td></tr><tr><td>    Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come,</td></tr><tr><td>    I dread, too late.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Too late, good Diomed. Call my guard, I prithee.</td></tr><tr><td>  DIOMEDES. What, ho! the Emperor's guard!

Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear</td></tr><tr><td>    All your true followers out.</td></tr><tr><td>  ALL. Most heavy day!</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate</td></tr><tr><td>    To grace it with your sorrows. Bid that welcome</td></tr><tr><td>    Which comes to punish us, and we punish it,</td></tr><tr><td>    Seeming to bear it lightly.

O Charmian, I will never go from hence!</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Be comforted, dear madam.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA.

Peace!</td></tr><tr><td>    Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony,</td></tr><tr><td>    But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. So it should be, that none but Antony</td></tr><tr><td>    Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. I am dying, Egypt, dying; only</td></tr><tr><td>    I here importune death awhile, until</td></tr><tr><td>    Of many thousand kisses the poor last</td></tr><tr><td>    I lay upon thy lips.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA.

O, quick, or I am gone.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!</td></tr><tr><td>    Our strength is all gone into heaviness;</td></tr><tr><td>    That makes the weight. Had I great Juno's power,</td></tr><tr><td>    The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,</td></tr><tr><td>    And set thee by Jove's side.

A heavy sight!</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. I am dying, Egypt, dying.</td></tr><tr><td>    Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. No, let me speak; and let me rail so high</td></tr><tr><td>    That the false huswife Fortune break her wheel,</td></tr><tr><td>    Provok'd by my offence.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. One word, sweet queen:</td></tr><tr><td>    Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. They do not go together.</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. Gentle, hear me:</td></tr><tr><td>    None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. My resolution and my hands I'll trust;</td></tr><tr><td>    None about Caesar</td></tr><tr><td>  ANTONY. The miserable change now at my end</td></tr><tr><td>    Lament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts</td></tr><tr><td>    In feeding them with those my former fortunes</td></tr><tr><td>    Wherein I liv'd the greatest prince o' th' world,</td></tr><tr><td>    The noblest; and do now not basely die,</td></tr><tr><td>    Not cowardly put off my helmet to</td></tr><tr><td>    My countryman- a Roman by a Roman</td></tr><tr><td>    Valiantly vanquish'd.

Shall I abide</td></tr><tr><td>    In this dull world, which in thy absence is</td></tr><tr><td>    No better than a sty? O, see, my women,        [Antony dies]</td></tr><tr><td>    The crown o' th' earth doth melt. My lord!</td></tr><tr><td>    O, wither'd is the garland of the war,</td></tr><tr><td>    The soldier's pole is fall'n! Young boys and girls</td></tr><tr><td>    Are level now with men. The odds is gone,</td></tr><tr><td>    And there is nothing left remarkable</td></tr><tr><td>    Beneath the visiting moon.                          [Swoons]</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. O, quietness, lady!</td></tr><tr><td>  IRAS. She's dead too, our sovereign.</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Lady!</td></tr><tr><td>  IRAS. Madam!</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. O madam, madam, madam!</td></tr><tr><td>  IRAS. Royal Egypt, Empress!</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. Peace, peace, Iras!</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. No more but e'en a woman, and commanded</td></tr><tr><td>    By such poor passion as the maid that milks</td></tr><tr><td>    And does the meanest chares. It were for me</td></tr><tr><td>    To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;</td></tr><tr><td>    To tell them that this world did equal theirs</td></tr><tr><td>    Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but nought;</td></tr><tr><td>    Patience is sottish, and impatience does</td></tr><tr><td>    Become a dog that's mad. Then is it sin</td></tr><tr><td>    To rush into the secret house of death</td></tr><tr><td>    Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?</td></tr><tr><td>    What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!</td></tr><tr><td>    My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,</td></tr><tr><td>    Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart.</td></tr><tr><td>    We'll bury him; and then, what's brave, what's noble,</td></tr><tr><td>    Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,</td></tr><tr><td>    And make death proud to take us. Come, away;</td></tr><tr><td>    This case of that huge spirit now is cold.</td></tr><tr><td>    Ah, women, women! Come; we have no friend</td></tr><tr><td>    But resolution and the briefest end.</td></tr><tr><td>                   Exeunt; those above hearing off ANTONY'S body</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>ACT_5|SC_1</td></tr><tr><td>                       ACT V. SCENE I.</td></tr><tr><td>                  Alexandria. CAESAR'S camp</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      Enter CAESAR, AGRIPPA, DOLABELLA, MAECENAS, GALLUS,</td></tr><tr><td>          PROCULEIUS, and others, his Council of War</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;</td></tr><tr><td>    Being so frustrate, tell him he mocks</td></tr><tr><td>    The pauses that he makes.</td></tr><tr><td>  DOLABELLA. Caesar, I shall.                               Exit</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>             Enter DERCETAS With the sword of ANTONY</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Wherefore is that? And what art thou that dar'st</td></tr><tr><td>    Appear thus to us?</td></tr><tr><td>  DERCETAS. I am call'd Dercetas;</td></tr><tr><td>    Mark Antony I serv'd, who best was worthy</td></tr><tr><td>    Best to be serv'd. Whilst he stood up and spoke,</td></tr><tr><td>    He was my master, and I wore my life</td></tr><tr><td>    To spend upon his haters. If thou please</td></tr><tr><td>    To take me to thee, as I was to him</td></tr><tr><td>    I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,</td></tr><tr><td>    I yield thee up my life.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. What is't thou say'st?</td></tr><tr><td>  DERCETAS. I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. The breaking of so great a thing should make</td></tr><tr><td>    A greater crack. The round world</td></tr><tr><td>    Should have shook lions into civil streets,</td></tr><tr><td>    And citizens to their dens. The death of Antony</td></tr><tr><td>    Is not a single doom; in the name lay</td></tr><tr><td>    A moiety of the world.</td></tr><tr><td>  DERCETAS. He is dead, Caesar,</td></tr><tr><td>    Not by a public minister of justice,</td></tr><tr><td>    Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand</td></tr><tr><td>    Which writ his honour in the acts it did</td></tr><tr><td>    Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,</td></tr><tr><td>    Splitted the heart. This is his sword;</td></tr><tr><td>    I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd</td></tr><tr><td>    With his most noble blood.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Look you sad, friends?</td></tr><tr><td>    The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings</td></tr><tr><td>    To wash the eyes of kings.</td></tr><tr><td>  AGRIPPA. And strange it is</td></tr><tr><td>    That nature must compel us to lament</td></tr><tr><td>    Our most persisted deeds.</td></tr><tr><td>  MAECENAS. His taints and honours</td></tr><tr><td>    Wag'd equal with him.</td></tr><tr><td>  AGRIPPA. A rarer spirit never</td></tr><tr><td>    Did steer humanity. But you gods will give us</td></tr><tr><td>    Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.</td></tr><tr><td>  MAECENAS. When such a spacious mirror's set before him,</td></tr><tr><td>    He needs must see himself.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. O Antony,</td></tr><tr><td>    I have follow'd thee to this! But we do lance</td></tr><tr><td>    Diseases in our bodies. I must perforce</td></tr><tr><td>    Have shown to thee such a declining day</td></tr><tr><td>    Or look on thine; we could not stall together</td></tr><tr><td>    In the whole world. But yet let me lament,</td></tr><tr><td>    With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,</td></tr><tr><td>    That thou, my brother, my competitor</td></tr><tr><td>    In top of all design, my mate in empire,</td></tr><tr><td>    Friend and companion in the front of war,</td></tr><tr><td>    The arm of mine own body, and the heart</td></tr><tr><td>    Where mine his thoughts did kindle- that our stars,</td></tr><tr><td>    Unreconciliable, should divide</td></tr><tr><td>    Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends-</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                    Enter an EGYPTIAN</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>    But I will tell you at some meeter season.</td></tr><tr><td>    The business of this man looks out of him;</td></tr><tr><td>    We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?</td></tr><tr><td>  EGYPTIAN. A poor Egyptian, yet the Queen, my mistress,</td></tr><tr><td>    Confin'd in all she has, her monument,</td></tr><tr><td>    Of thy intents desires instruction,</td></tr><tr><td>    That she preparedly may frame herself</td></tr><tr><td>    To th' way she's forc'd to.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Bid her have good heart.</td></tr><tr><td>    She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,</td></tr><tr><td>    How honourable and how kindly we</td></tr><tr><td>    Determine for her; for Caesar cannot learn</td></tr><tr><td>    To be ungentle.</td></tr><tr><td>  EGYPTIAN. So the gods preserve thee!                      Exit</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say</td></tr><tr><td>    We purpose her no shame. Give her what comforts</td></tr><tr><td>    The quality of her passion shall require,</td></tr><tr><td>    Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke</td></tr><tr><td>    She do defeat us; for her life in Rome</td></tr><tr><td>    Would be eternal in our triumph. Go,</td></tr><tr><td>    And with your speediest bring us what she says,</td></tr><tr><td>    And how you find her.</td></tr><tr><td>  PROCULEIUS. Caesar, I shall.                              Exit</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Gallus, go you along.                      Exit GALLUS</td></tr><tr><td>    Where's Dolabella, to second Proculeius?</td></tr><tr><td>  ALL. Dolabella!</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Let him alone, for I remember now</td></tr><tr><td>    How he's employ'd; he shall in time be ready.</td></tr><tr><td>    Go with me to my tent, where you shall see</td></tr><tr><td>    How hardly I was drawn into this war,</td></tr><tr><td>    How calm and gentle I proceeded still</td></tr><tr><td>    In all my writings. Go with me, and see</td></tr><tr><td>    What I can show in this.                              Exeunt</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>ACT_5|SC_2</td></tr><tr><td>                         SCENE II.</td></tr><tr><td>                Alexandria. The monument</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. My desolation does begin to make</td></tr><tr><td>    A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar:</td></tr><tr><td>    Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,</td></tr><tr><td>    A minister of her will; and it is great</td></tr><tr><td>    To do that thing that ends all other deeds,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which shackles accidents and bolts up change,</td></tr><tr><td>    Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,</td></tr><tr><td>    The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>       Enter, to the gates of the monument, PROCULEIUS, GALLUS,</td></tr><tr><td>                          and soldiers</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  PROCULEIUS. Caesar sends greetings to the Queen of Egypt,</td></tr><tr><td>    And bids thee study on what fair demands</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou mean'st to have him grant thee.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. What's thy name?</td></tr><tr><td>  PROCULEIUS. My name is Proculeius.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Antony</td></tr><tr><td>    Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but</td></tr><tr><td>    I do not greatly care to be deceiv'd,</td></tr><tr><td>    That have no use for trusting. If your master</td></tr><tr><td>    Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him</td></tr><tr><td>    That majesty, to keep decorum, must</td></tr><tr><td>    No less beg than a kingdom. If he please</td></tr><tr><td>    To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,</td></tr><tr><td>    He gives me so much of mine own as I</td></tr><tr><td>    Will kneel to him with thanks.</td></tr><tr><td>  PROCULEIUS. Be of good cheer;</td></tr><tr><td>    Y'are fall'n into a princely hand; fear nothing.</td></tr><tr><td>    Make your full reference freely to my lord,</td></tr><tr><td>    Who is so full of grace that it flows over</td></tr><tr><td>    On all that need. Let me report to him</td></tr><tr><td>    Your sweet dependency, and you shall find</td></tr><tr><td>    A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness</td></tr><tr><td>    Where he for grace is kneel'd to.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Pray you tell him</td></tr><tr><td>    I am his fortune's vassal and I send him</td></tr><tr><td>    The greatness he has got. I hourly learn</td></tr><tr><td>    A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly</td></tr><tr><td>    Look him i' th' face.</td></tr><tr><td>  PROCULEIUS. This I'll report, dear lady.</td></tr><tr><td>    Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied</td></tr><tr><td>    Of him that caus'd it.</td></tr><tr><td>  GALLUS. You see how easily she may be surpris'd.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      Here PROCULEIUS and two of the guard ascend the</td></tr><tr><td>       monument by a ladder placed against a window,</td></tr><tr><td>       and come behind CLEOPATRA. Some of the guard</td></tr><tr><td>                unbar and open the gates</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>    Guard her till Caesar come.                             Exit</td></tr><tr><td>  IRAS. Royal Queen!</td></tr><tr><td>  CHARMIAN. O Cleopatra! thou art taken, Queen!</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Quick, quick, good hands.        [Drawing a dagger]</td></tr><tr><td>  PROCULEIUS. Hold, worthy lady, hold,             [Disarms her]</td></tr><tr><td>    Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this</td></tr><tr><td>    Reliev'd, but not betray'd.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. What, of death too,</td></tr><tr><td>    That rids our dogs of languish?</td></tr><tr><td>  PROCULEIUS. Cleopatra,</td></tr><tr><td>    Do not abuse my master's bounty by</td></tr><tr><td>    Th' undoing of yourself. Let the world see</td></tr><tr><td>    His nobleness well acted, which your death</td></tr><tr><td>    Will never let come forth.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Where art thou, death?</td></tr><tr><td>    Come hither, come! Come, come, and take a queen</td></tr><tr><td>    Worth many babes and beggars!</td></tr><tr><td>  PROCULEIUS. O, temperance, lady!</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Sir, I will eat no meat; I'll not drink, sir;</td></tr><tr><td>    If idle talk will once be necessary,</td></tr><tr><td>    I'll not sleep neither. This mortal house I'll ruin,</td></tr><tr><td>    Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I</td></tr><tr><td>    Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court,</td></tr><tr><td>    Nor once be chastis'd with the sober eye</td></tr><tr><td>    Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up,</td></tr><tr><td>    And show me to the shouting varletry</td></tr><tr><td>    Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt</td></tr><tr><td>    Be gentle grave unto me! Rather on Nilus' mud</td></tr><tr><td>    Lay me stark-nak'd, and let the water-flies</td></tr><tr><td>    Blow me into abhorring! Rather make</td></tr><tr><td>    My country's high pyramides my gibbet,</td></tr><tr><td>    And hang me up in chains!</td></tr><tr><td>  PROCULEIUS. You do extend</td></tr><tr><td>    These thoughts of horror further than you shall</td></tr><tr><td>    Find cause in Caesar.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>                      Enter DOLABELLA</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  DOLABELLA. Proculeius,</td></tr><tr><td>    What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,</td></tr><tr><td>    And he hath sent for thee. For the Queen,</td></tr><tr><td>    I'll take her to my guard.</td></tr><tr><td>  PROCULEIUS. So, Dolabella,</td></tr><tr><td>    It shall content me best. Be gentle to her.</td></tr><tr><td>    [To CLEOPATRA] To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,</td></tr><tr><td>    If you'll employ me to him.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Say I would die.</td></tr><tr><td>                                  Exeunt PROCULEIUS and soldiers</td></tr><tr><td>  DOLABELLA. Most noble Empress, you have heard of me?</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. I cannot tell.</td></tr><tr><td>  DOLABELLA. Assuredly you know me.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.</td></tr><tr><td>    You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;</td></tr><tr><td>    Is't not your trick?</td></tr><tr><td>  DOLABELLA. I understand not, madam.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. I dreamt there was an Emperor Antony-</td></tr><tr><td>    O, such another sleep, that I might see</td></tr><tr><td>    But such another man!</td></tr><tr><td>  DOLABELLA. If it might please ye-</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. His face was as the heav'ns, and therein stuck</td></tr><tr><td>    A sun and moon, which kept their course and lighted</td></tr><tr><td>    The little O, the earth.</td></tr><tr><td>  DOLABELLA. Most sovereign creature-</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. His legs bestrid the ocean; his rear'd arm</td></tr><tr><td>    Crested the world. His voice was propertied</td></tr><tr><td>    As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;</td></tr><tr><td>    But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,</td></tr><tr><td>    He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,</td></tr><tr><td>    There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas</td></tr><tr><td>    That grew the more by reaping. His delights</td></tr><tr><td>    Were dolphin-like: they show'd his back above</td></tr><tr><td>    The element they liv'd in. In his livery</td></tr><tr><td>    Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were</td></tr><tr><td>    As plates dropp'd from his pocket.</td></tr><tr><td>  DOLABELLA. Cleopatra-</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Think you there was or might be such a man</td></tr><tr><td>    As this I dreamt of?</td></tr><tr><td>  DOLABELLA. Gentle madam, no.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.</td></tr><tr><td>    But if there be nor ever were one such,</td></tr><tr><td>    It's past the size of drearning. Nature wants stuff</td></tr><tr><td>    To vie strange forms with fancy; yet t' imagine</td></tr><tr><td>    An Antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,</td></tr><tr><td>    Condemning shadows quite.</td></tr><tr><td>  DOLABELLA. Hear me, good madam.</td></tr><tr><td>    Your loss is, as yourself, great; and you bear it</td></tr><tr><td>    As answering to the weight. Would I might never</td></tr><tr><td>    O'ertake pursu'd success, but I do feel,</td></tr><tr><td>    By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites</td></tr><tr><td>    My very heart at root.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. I thank you, sir.</td></tr><tr><td>    Know you what Caesar means to do with me?</td></tr><tr><td>  DOLABELLA. I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Nay, pray you, sir.</td></tr><tr><td>  DOLABELLA. Though he be honourable-</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. He'll lead me, then, in triumph?</td></tr><tr><td>  DOLABELLA. Madam, he will. I know't.                [Flourish]</td></tr><tr><td>                              [Within: 'Make way there-Caesar!']</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>       Enter CAESAR; GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, MAECENAS, SELEUCUS,</td></tr><tr><td>                     and others of his train</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Which is the Queen of Egypt?</td></tr><tr><td>  DOLABELLA. It is the Emperor, madam.        [CLEOPATPA kneels]</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Arise, you shall not kneel.</td></tr><tr><td>    I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Sir, the gods</td></tr><tr><td>    Will have it thus; my master and my lord</td></tr><tr><td>    I must obey.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Take to you no hard thoughts.</td></tr><tr><td>    The record of what injuries you did us,</td></tr><tr><td>    Though written in our flesh, we shall remember</td></tr><tr><td>    As things but done by chance.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Sole sir o' th' world,</td></tr><tr><td>    I cannot project mine own cause so well</td></tr><tr><td>    To make it clear, but do confess I have</td></tr><tr><td>    Been laden with like frailties which before</td></tr><tr><td>    Have often sham'd our sex.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Cleopatra, know</td></tr><tr><td>    We will extenuate rather than enforce.</td></tr><tr><td>    If you apply yourself to our intents-</td></tr><tr><td>    Which towards you are most gentle- you shall find</td></tr><tr><td>    A benefit in this change; but if you seek</td></tr><tr><td>    To lay on me a cruelty by taking</td></tr><tr><td>    Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself</td></tr><tr><td>    Of my good purposes, and put your children</td></tr><tr><td>    To that destruction which I'll guard them from,</td></tr><tr><td>    If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. And may, through all the world. 'Tis yours, and we,</td></tr><tr><td>    Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall</td></tr><tr><td>    Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,</td></tr><tr><td>    I am possess'd of. 'Tis exactly valued,</td></tr><tr><td>    Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?</td></tr><tr><td>  SELEUCUS. Here, madam.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. This is my treasurer; let him speak, my lord,</td></tr><tr><td>    Upon his peril, that I have reserv'd</td></tr><tr><td>    To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.</td></tr><tr><td>  SELEUCUS. Madam,</td></tr><tr><td>    I had rather seal my lips than to my peril</td></tr><tr><td>    Speak that which is not.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. What have I kept back?</td></tr><tr><td>  SELEUCUS. Enough to purchase what you have made known.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve</td></tr><tr><td>    Your wisdom in the deed.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. See, Caesar! O, behold,</td></tr><tr><td>    How pomp is followed! Mine will now be yours;</td></tr><tr><td>    And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.</td></tr><tr><td>    The ingratitude of this Seleucus does</td></tr><tr><td>    Even make me wild. O slave, of no more trust</td></tr><tr><td>    Than love that's hir'd! What, goest thou back? Thou shalt</td></tr><tr><td>    Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes</td></tr><tr><td>    Though they had wings. Slave, soulless villain, dog!</td></tr><tr><td>    O rarely base!</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Good Queen, let us entreat you.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,</td></tr><tr><td>    That thou vouchsafing here to visit me,</td></tr><tr><td>    Doing the honour of thy lordliness</td></tr><tr><td>    To one so meek, that mine own servant should</td></tr><tr><td>    Parcel the sum of my disgraces by</td></tr><tr><td>    Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,</td></tr><tr><td>    That I some lady trifles have reserv'd,</td></tr><tr><td>    Immoment toys, things of such dignity</td></tr><tr><td>    As we greet modern friends withal; and say</td></tr><tr><td>    Some nobler token I have kept apart</td></tr><tr><td>    For Livia and Octavia, to induce</td></tr><tr><td>    Their mediation- must I be unfolded</td></tr><tr><td>    With one that I have bred? The gods! It smites me</td></tr><tr><td>    Beneath the fall I have. [To SELEUCUS] Prithee go hence;</td></tr><tr><td>    Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits</td></tr><tr><td>    Through th' ashes of my chance. Wert thou a man,</td></tr><tr><td>    Thou wouldst have mercy on me.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Forbear, Seleucus.                       Exit SELEUCUS</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. Be it known that we, the greatest, are misthought</td></tr><tr><td>    For things that others do; and when we fall</td></tr><tr><td>    We answer others' merits in our name,</td></tr><tr><td>    Are therefore to be pitied.</td></tr><tr><td>  CAESAR. Cleopatra,</td></tr><tr><td>    Not what you have reserv'd, nor what acknowledg'd,</td></tr><tr><td>    Put we i' th' roll of conquest. Still be't yours,</td></tr><tr><td>    Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe</td></tr><tr><td>    Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you</td></tr><tr><td>    Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;</td></tr><tr><td>    Make not your thoughts your prisons. No, dear Queen;</td></tr><tr><td>    For we intend so to dispose you as</td></tr><tr><td>    Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed and sleep.</td></tr><tr><td>    Our care and pity is so much upon you</td></tr><tr><td>    That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.</td></tr><tr><td>  CLEOPATRA. My master and my lord!</td></tr></tbody></table>Showing the first 10000 rows.</div>"
